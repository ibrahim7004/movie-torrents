There's a man goin' 'round takin' names

1790
02:11:21,927 --> 02:11:25,727
And he decides who to free and who to blame

1791
02:11:27,466 --> 02:11:30,765
Everybody won't be treated all the same

1792
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:35,264
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down

1793
02:11:38,377 --> 02:11:40,902
When the man comes around

1794
02:11:44,683 --> 02:11:48,278
The hairs on your arm will stand up

1795
02:11:49,621 --> 02:11:53,182
At the terror in each sip and in each sup

1796
02:11:54,793 --> 02:11:58,092
For you partake of that last offered cup

1797
02:11:59,665 --> 02:12:03,157
Or disappear into the potter's ground

1798
02:12:05,704 --> 02:12:07,672
When the man comes around

1799
02:12:09,841 --> 02:12:12,503
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers

1800
02:12:14,346 --> 02:12:17,440
One hundred million angels singing

1801
02:12:19,551 --> 02:12:24,181
Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum

1802
02:12:25,757 --> 02:12:28,954
Voices callin', voices cryin'

1803
02:12:30,696 --> 02:12:33,824
Some are born an'some are dyin'

1804
02:12:35,167 --> 02:12:38,830
It's Alpha's and Omega's kingdom come

1805
02:12:40,038 --> 02:12:44,202
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1806
02:12:45,377 --> 02:12:48,574
The virgins are all trimming their wicks

1807
02:12:50,282 --> 02:12:54,582
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1808
02:12:55,187 --> 02:12:58,714
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

1809
02:13:02,361 --> 02:13:05,990
Till Armageddon no Shalam, no Shalom

1810
02:13:07,399 --> 02:13:10,891
Then the father hen
will call his chickens home

1811
02:13:12,437 --> 02:13:15,565
The wise men will bow down before the throne

1812
02:13:17,309 --> 02:13:20,710
And at his feet they'll cast
their golden crown

1813
02:13:23,415 --> 02:13:25,747
When the man comes around

1814
02:13:27,252 --> 02:13:31,848
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still

1815
02:13:32,624 --> 02:13:36,856
Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still

1816
02:13:37,162 --> 02:13:41,690
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still

1817
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:45,295
Listen to the words long written down

1818
02:13:47,906 --> 02:13:50,204
When the man comes around

1819
02:13:51,977 --> 02:13:55,242
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers

1820
02:13:56,481 --> 02:13:59,382
One hundred million angels singin'

1821
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:06,723
Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum

1822
02:14:07,959 --> 02:14:11,122
Voices callin', voices cryin'

1823
02:14:12,864 --> 02:14:16,231
Some are born an'some are dyin'

1824
02:14:17,402 --> 02:14:21,702
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

1825
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:26,201
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1826
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:30,806
The virgins are all trimming their wicks

1827
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:36,246
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1828
02:14:36,988 --> 02:14:40,389
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

1829
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:45,728
In measured hundredweight and penny pound

1830
02:14:47,833 --> 02:14:49,960
When the man comes around
