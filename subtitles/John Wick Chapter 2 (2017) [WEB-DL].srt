688

Mr. Wick doesn't remember, but we met many years ago,

689
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,571
before my ascension...

690
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,475
When I was just a pawn in the game.

691
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,979
We met and you gave me a gift,

692
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,814
the gift that would make me a king.

693
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,620
You don't remember, but there I was, standing in an alleyway.

694
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,857
I didn't even hear you comin'.

695
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,729
You gave me this.

696
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,603
Gift from the Boogeyman.

697
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,239
Perfect for every occasion.

698
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:57,011
But you also gave me a choice.

699
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:00,949
Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die.

700
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,351
Or keep the pressure on my neck...

701
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:05,853
...and live.

702
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:11,292
And so you see, I survived.

703
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:16,297
No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.

704
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:19,734
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

705
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,838

713

You have eyes begging for change on every corner in the city.

714

I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

715

Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

721

Would you like a back rub with that, John?

722

You're going to help me.

723
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,465
Why the fuck would I do that?

724

Because I'm the only one that can help you.

How much help does it look like I need?

733
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:16,484
It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick,

734
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:20,521
is who in this cruel world of ours is going to help you?

735
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,038
There's a storm coming.

736
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:40,508
Not just for me. For all of us.

737
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,910
For everyone under the Table.

738
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,046
Yes, killing someone who has a seat at the High Table

739
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:46,781
does create a problem.

740
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,816
But it's your problem, baby.

741
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:54,188
After all, none of my people sent Gianna D'Antonio

to the hereafter.

743
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:01,496
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

744
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,665
And he wants the city.

745
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:08,736
When he's done uptown, you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

746
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,806
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

747

You kill Santino,

751

He's offered $7 million for your life.

753

$7 million is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.
