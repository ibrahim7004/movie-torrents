00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,259
<i>October 7, 2007.</i>

3
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:17,271
<i>Four days till we deploy.</i>

4
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,565
<i>Grace knows I would do
anything to get back to her.</i>

5
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:23,471
<i>Anything.</i>

6
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,139
<i>Today I wrote her a letter.</i>

7
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:43,423
Good afternoon, sir. I have the briefing
papers from the colonel's office.

8
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,294
Put them on the desk.

9
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:51,033
Thank you, Corporal.

10
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,443
Major. Hey.

11
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,782
Hope you don't have to deliver it.

12
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:05,476
Copy that.

13
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,616
- Be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

14
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:09,986
- See you when you get back.
- All right.

15
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,396
How's this?

16
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:20,592
Warm.

17
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:25,870
- Hello.
- Dad!

18
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,066
Hey! Hey, baby.

19
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,370
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing?

20
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,172
- How was school?
- Great.

21
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:35,375
They gave me Noodles the
dog. She's in my room.

22
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,315
Izzie?

23
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,185
Hey.

24
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,218
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,894
What's wrong, honey?

26
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,757
You're leaving again.

27
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,359
Come give your daddy a hug.

28
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:52,999
No.

29
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,900
Come on. Give me a kiss, honey.

30
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,197
Just go.

31
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,104
- Two kisses?
- No.

32
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,475
Three kisses?

33
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:05,009
I wanna read my book.

34
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:07,080
You wanna read your book?

35
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:09,945
Oh, yeah?

36
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:16,924
I see a smile coming. There it is! There
it is! Now, you're getting 100 kisses!

37
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:20,493
- Behind you! Right behind you!
- What? What? What? Who? Who?

38
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:25,665
Wait a second! Two against
one. That is no fair!

39
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,324
Daddy, put me down!

40
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:28,401
Girls.

41
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,432
- Come on. Daddy's gotta go.
- Okay.

42
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:36,010
Please stay. Please let him stay.

43
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:39,705
- Yeah. Can't you stay?
- It's my brother.

44
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,679
He doesn't deserve you.

45
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:45,412
Go rob another bank, Tommy!

46
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,185
Bring that money back to me, brother!

47
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:58,765
See you later.

48
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,083
What happened to my little brother?

49
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,566
No fucking way.

50
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,891
You ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

51
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,862
It's green.

52
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,896
I got it.

53
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,240
So, what are you gonna do?

54
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:28,687
I don't know. I'm just gonna cash
this check, and then who knows.

55
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:30,987
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

56
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,719
- Don't rob the place.
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

57
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:50,543
No hot water in this place?

58
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:54,347
Fucking hot water is missing.

59
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:03,349
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,652
How do you stand this kitchen?

61
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:08,661
He didn't expect to be
deploying again so soon.

62
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,526
Yeah. Well, are you
ripping your hair out?

63
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,963
What are you gonna do?
They call, you answer.

64
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,693
- Don't tell her. Oh, no.
- Yes!

65
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,736
- I won.
- She got you, Granddad.

66
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,771
You're raising a real
hustler here, Grace.

67
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,238
I know.

68
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,940
My birthday's this spring.

69
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,515
It is, isn't it? What is it,
March 10th, something like that?

70
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,747
- Hi.
- Hi.

71
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:38,449
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie.

72
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,116
Isabelle's big.

73
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:42,886
I'm Tommy.

74
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,554
Mom doesn't like you.

75
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:45,824
Maggie!

76
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,333
What? That's what you said to Dad.

77
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:51,402
These are for your mom.

78
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,431
Mom, they're for you.

79
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,838
Thank you.

80
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:57,771
Come in.

81
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:02,012
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

82
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,674
Come here.

83
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:05,676
Hi.

84
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,453
You made it.

85
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,779
Yeah.

86
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,623
- Son.
- Sir.

87
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,494
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,502
Bless us, O Lord, in these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

89
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:25,572
from thy bounty through
Christ, our Lord. Amen.

90
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:26,935
- Amen.
- Amen.

91
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:31,444
And this is a very special meal for us
because we are welcoming one son home,

92
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,446
and we're sending another one off.

93
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:38,848
And we ask you, Lord, to keep him safe
and bring him back really soon. Right?

94
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:39,976
- Yeah.
- Amen.

95
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:41,452
- Amen.
- Amen.

96
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,613
Here. You can do it.

97
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,554
- You wanna try?
- Thank you, Mom.

98
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,161
- Here, let me.
- Thanks, Mama.

99
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:51,226
Carrots are delicious.

100
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:01,766
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

101
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,673
I do, too.

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,705
Honey, eat your peas.

103
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:08,781
Okay, Dad.

104
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,248
I like peas.

105
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:12,518
So do I.

106
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:14,884
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

107
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,217
You love it over there, huh?

108
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,194
It's my job.

109
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,458
They only shoot the bad guys.

110
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,796
Who are the bad guys?

111
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,505
The ones with the beards.

112
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,241
Your brother's a hero.

113
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,271
He's serving his country, and
don't you ever forget that.

114
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:46,317
Will you be here for my birthday?

115
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:49,089
You know I will, sweetie.

116
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,488
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't
there for her birthday.

117
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:55,226
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

118
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,923
She had to bring him a cake in prison.

119
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,532
It's not just military families.

120
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,263
There's a lot of folks
under pressure these days.

121
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,969
They got problems in all walks of life.

122
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:12,311
Every family's got their
own set of problems.

123
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,315
They sure do.

124
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,315
What is that supposed to mean?

125
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:28,852
Every family has their
own set of problems.

126
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,260
You sound like a damn parrot.

127
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,661
Like a what?

128
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,564
Why don't you try mimicking
your brother for a change?

129
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:36,931
Dad.

130
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:41,098
This food is great, Elsie. Thank you.

131
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,535
Compared to what?

132
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:50,982
Other food.

133
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,643
Prison food?

134
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:53,879
Tommy!

135
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:01,723
Excuse me.

136
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,060
It's okay, honey.

137
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,295
- No. No.
- It's his first night out.

138
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:14,704
He comes waltzing in here with
no regard for anybody else.

139
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:16,901
Doesn't even bother to apologize...

140
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,887
Stay out of trouble.

141
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,826
All right.

142
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,803
You be safe over there. All right?

143
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:59,080
This thing's not coming off.

144
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,615
- Try more soap.
- Yeah.

145
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,223
Almost got it.

146
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,996
There we go.

147
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,894
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

148
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:16,230
Okay.

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,071
- Take a lot of pictures when I'm gone.
- I always do.

150
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,078
I love you.

151
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,440
I love you, too.

152
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,105
Sam?

153
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,909
Take me with you.

154
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:07,645
Sure.

155
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,490
How about I go and
you stay with the kids?

156
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:18,257
Okay.

157
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,836
Don't go.

158
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:31,873
<i>October 12, 2007.</i>

159
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,180
<i>Back in Afghanistan with my men.</i>

160
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:41,853
<i>Weird. It almost feels like home.</i>

161
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,390
Hi, Cassie. Joe Jr. is so big.

162
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:46,119
What's the distance to the LZ?

163
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:49,280
We're three minutes out.
Clear to detach to the LZ.

164
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,481
Roger that.

165
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,932
<i>Clear to engage. Weapons hot.</i>

166
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:03,431
<i>Target took cover in the valley.</i>

167
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:04,765
Little bastards...

168
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,800
Who is it?

169
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:47,005
It's Captain Sanderson
and Chaplain Davis.

170
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:51,483
Hi.

171
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:56,150
- Hi. Is your mother home?
- Yeah.

172
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,725
Where is she?

173
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,760
In the bath.

174
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,459
Would you call her for us, please?

175
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,338
What's wrong?

176
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,270
Izzie.

177
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,076
- Okay.
- Bye.

178
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,161
Come in.

179
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:13,325
<i>You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.</i>

180
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,102
<i>You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.</i>

181
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,594
Grace.

182
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,865
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

183
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:49,264
I was just dropping off the car.

184
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:52,804
Sam told me I could borrow
it whenever I wanted, so...

185
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,137
The taillight's a little
busted. Some asshole...

186
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,312
Look, you know...

187
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,453
Just say it, you know
what I mean? All right.

188
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,422
He told me I could borrow the
car whenever I wanted, Grace.

189
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,025
You look at me with
this pissed-off look.

190
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,593
Sam's dead.

191
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,397
They crashed.

192
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,760
- What are you talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

193
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,202
Come in, come in.

194
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:34,774
I don't wanna fucking come in.

195
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:38,948
I just came here to drop off...

196
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:43,052
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

197
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:47,126
- Why didn't anybody call me?
- We've all been trying, Tommy.

198
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,057
Okay.

199
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:53,994
- Why'd you let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy.

200
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,065
For what now, huh?

201
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,952
Tommy, come inside.

202
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:24,396
I just had to sit down for a second.

203
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,939
He's with your mama
now. They're together.

204
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,201
Drink?

205
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:12,067
No.

206
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:45,802
Girls? You ready?

207
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:49,439
Yeah, in about just one minute.

208
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,415
- Why'd you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

209
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,792
We're going to put it
on, okay? We have to go.

210
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:00,683
I don't want to.

211
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:05,065
I don't want to wear
mine either. It's itchy.

212
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,511
Okay, come here. Okay.

213
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:23,816
Come here.

214
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,983
- Okay.
- Is Dad really dead like your mom and dad?

215
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,767
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it.

216
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,447
- I'm so sorry, dear.
- Thanks for coming.

217
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,924
Sir, your son's the best
damn Marine I ever commanded.

218
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,526
I appreciate it.

219
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,398
- Come on, girls.
- Coming, Grandpa.

220
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,431
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Maggie.

221
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,093
- Elsie, I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'll watch them.

222
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:51,329
Okay.

223
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:56,409
Grace, Sam wrote this for you before he left.
He never wanted me to have to deliver it.

224
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:04,584
I don't believe it, John.

225
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:07,010
I can't feel it.

226
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,952
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

227
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:15,827
It's hard to accept. He was
a good friend, a good Marine.

228
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,498
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

229
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:23,000
- Come on, girls.
- Coming.

230
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:26,135
Hey, why don't you
give me the keys, Dad?

231
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:27,797
What makes you so
responsible all of a sudden?

232
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,702
Let Tommy drive.

233
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:34,177
"Let Tommy drive."
Look, I'll tell you what.

234
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:36,544
Why don't you get a
job and earn some money,

235
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:37,809
buy yourself a car,

236
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,920
and then you can drive it
wherever the hell you want.

237
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:42,544
Give me the keys.

238
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,754
Did you hear those Marines in there
today talking about your brother?

239
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,123
Did you?

240
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:55,534
Who is gonna stand up and
testify for you once you're dead?

241
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,401
Yeah, it's my fault Sam's dead.
Right? That's what you think.

242
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,434
It's got nothing to do with you. Right?

243
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:08,177
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

244
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:12,717
Forget it.

245
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:15,584
You never had any guts.

246
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:17,314
And you did.

247
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,823
That's why you screamed
at Mom every fucking night.

248
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,554
That's why you drove us drunk,
huh? "Hang in there, Marines."

249
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:26,062
- Don't. Come on.
- Why you put all that shit in his head.

250
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,327
- You could never fill his shoes.
- I know that.

251
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,994
- Never could make me proud.
- For Lord's sake.

252
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:32,765
That is a sin.

253
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:36,342
- Stop it. Give me the keys.
- Here you go. I'm walking.

254
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:09,897
This is a nightmare.

255
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,895
What's going on?

256
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,703
What are they gonna do with us?

257
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,410
That yours?

258
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:21,371
Yeah.

259
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:23,549
That your wife?

260
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:25,683
Cassie, yeah.

261
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:28,820
No, she's not.

262
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,953
You don't have a wife.

263
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:34,189
You don't have a family.

264
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:37,456
I'm the only person you know.

265
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:42,765
It's Private Willis and Captain
Cahill. You know nothing else.

266
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,131
Yes, sir.

267
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,851
- Hello?
- Grace.

268
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:06,958
<i>Tommy?</i>

269
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,691
- Hi. I know it's like 1:00 in the morning.
- Yeah. It's 3:00.

270
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,994
It's 3:00 in the morning.

271
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:15,624
Okay. I had...

272
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:19,171
I had a couple of
drinks and, apparently,

273
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:22,798
they're the most expensive
drinks in the world. And...

274
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:26,269
Now I owe, like, $47.

275
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:30,145
I was gonna just walk out, but then

276
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,377
this guy says that he was
gonna nick me on a disorderly.

277
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:36,584
<i>And then I'd lose my parole, so...</i>

278
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:40,288
Which bar?

279
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:54,240
Your nose is like the lunar eclipse.

280
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:57,977
- Come on, let me touch it. Let me just...
- Get your hands off me, Tommy.

281
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,205
- Let me just touch it for a sec.
- Tommy, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you.

282
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:02,474
Don't get so upset with me.

283
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,311
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

284
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,078
See. Nothing to it. Right?

285
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,278
- Big deal.
- That thing's huge, man.

286
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,014
- Hi.
- Great.

287
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,091
- How much does he owe you?
- $47 and two broken glasses.

288
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:15,194
- Well, how about we say...
- Ready?

289
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:17,592
- Come on, Cyrano.
- Get your hands off the bar.

290
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:21,189
- Don't try to ignore it. That thing's huge.
- How about we say $50. Okay?

291
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,824
- I don't care about the money...
- That thing's huge.

292
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:24,903
...just get him out of here. I'm
gonna call the cops. I'm done.

293
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,872
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at 3:00 in the morning.

294
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:30,840
You think you're funny?

295
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:35,642
Go home.

296
00:27:50,263 --> 00:27:51,628
Oh, God.

297
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,601
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

298
00:27:57,738 --> 00:28:01,265
- I don't think I should be carrying a child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay?

299
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,773
Oh, my God.

300
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:12,349
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

301
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,386
Uncle Tommy, wake up.

302
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:18,920
Can you stop that?

303
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:22,789
I'm making pancakes for Mom.
I can't stop. My sister said.

304
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,398
Stop it.

305
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:30,395
No.

306
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:43,973
What are you doing here?

307
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,950
You want me to whisk in your face, too?

308
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:50,545
This is not your house, and
you're not the boss of me.

309
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:58,357
Come on.

310
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,833
We're making pancakes for
Mom, so she won't be sad.

311
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:09,908
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

312
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:11,442
I know that.

313
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,479
No drinking out of
the carton! It's gross!

314
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,013
Shut up. You're gross.

315
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,776
- No!
- You want a pancake?

316
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,946
No, I don't like pancakes.

317
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:27,286
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, all right?

318
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,224
Mom! You're supposed to be upstairs.

319
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:32,456
- What are you doing awake?
- It's a surprise!

320
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,796
I am surprised. Thank you.

321
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:39,372
The nicest little girls in the world.

322
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,233
Who's that?

323
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:47,039
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

324
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,247
- Hey, babies.
- Hi!

325
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:52,078
- What have you got in your hair?
- Pancake batter.

326
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:54,414
- Pancake batter.
- Hi, sweetie.

327
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:58,488
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

328
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:01,387
- I'll get the syrup.
- What a mess.

329
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:04,826
- Bye, Tommy.
- We'll clean this up later.

330
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:20,009
Morning.

331
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:24,908
Pancakes, huh?

332
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:30,153
Yeah, actually there's one
on the floor if you want it.

333
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,632
- What are they doing in here?
- They were making pancakes.

334
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:50,274
Look...

335
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:55,272
- I was a little stupid the other day.
- Yeah, hey.

336
00:30:56,917 --> 00:31:01,047
- I was okay to drive, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

337
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,700
I know Sam was always smarter than me.

338
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:31,848
Well, I don't know about smarter.
He was a damn good athlete.

339
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,715
Remember that game against Easton?

340
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,916
Cool as ice.

341
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:49,727
You had some talent,
too, you know. I mean...

342
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,468
You just quit all the time.

343
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:56,734
Now, that was the difference
between you and him.

344
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,410
Sam had no quit in him.

345
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:26,469
I'd cut my throat to
bring him back, Dad.

346
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:35,576
God damn it.

347
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:40,345
I don't know how she lives
with this kitchen the way it is.

348
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:53,891
Private, come here. Fucking help me.

349
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,763
I can't see anything.

350
00:32:58,138 --> 00:32:59,628
They're looking for us.

351
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:03,306
All right.

352
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:24,991
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

353
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:49,255
Come on, man. Just put
it where you got it.

354
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:51,016
Grace. Hey.

355
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,025
You remember, A.J., Owen.

356
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:02,333
Sweeney... I don't
remember your first name.

357
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:03,834
There's a reason for that.

358
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,165
- It's nice to meet you, Grace.
- You, too.

359
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,631
What's going on?

360
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:13,804
We're just fixing up
the kitchen for you.

361
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:16,541
Tommy.

362
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:22,414
Were you ever going to run this by me?

363
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:25,023
- Can you believe it? She's gorgeous.
- It's my house.

364
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:26,625
- Somebody's all growed up.
- It's not funny.

365
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:29,956
What the hell is wrong
with you guys? She's been...

366
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:32,121
You have to run this by me.

367
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:38,031
I was...

368
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:46,234
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

369
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:50,576
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer, too.

370
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:53,080
Don't tell them anything.

371
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,119
Don't you tell them anything, Private.

372
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,080
They're not asking me anything.

373
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,592
They're just starving us.

374
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,352
Stay calm, Private.

375
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:07,199
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

376
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:11,201
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

377
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:14,773
What the fuck did you save me
for? Why did you come after me?

378
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:19,205
I should've drowned in that lake.
We'd both be better off dead.

379
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:23,438
What day is it?

380
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:37,024
Saturday.

381
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:40,990
What time is it?

382
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:50,237
About noon.

383
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,004
You remember what I told you.

384
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:27,374
No information. You give them nothing.
You give them nothing, Private.

385
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:28,502
Yeah.

386
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:40,849
- Where are they taking us?
- Don't speak. Don't speak!

387
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:49,225
- Are they gonna cut our heads off?
- Not another fucking word!

388
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,036
Welcome.

389
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,252
I used the satellite
phone to call my wife.

390
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:47,652
She's pregnant.

391
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,721
I jeopardized your
location and your mission.

392
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:54,399
We have the same blood.

393
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,727
Syed is my nephew.

394
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:24,092
Fuck them.

395
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,736
This is our country.

396
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,540
You should not be here.

397
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,806
Tell this message to America.

398
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:46,917
You say it,

399
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,188
or I'll force you to say it.

400
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,500
The girls are back.

401
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:44,068
It's a good thing downstairs.

402
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,813
I'll see you tomorrow.

403
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,781
Thanks, Elsie.

404
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:56,954
Okay.

405
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:07,060
- Who is painting the kitchen?
- I am.

406
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:10,869
Get that spot right there.

407
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,801
You know, your dad was a great
football player in high school.

408
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,305
- Really?
- Yeah.

409
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:19,044
He was small, but he
was a great quarterback.

410
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:24,446
Me and A.J. and Owen used to go to
the games just to watch him play.

411
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,850
Did you ever have a
chance to see him play?

412
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:28,921
No.

413
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,615
- Izzie, you're so tall.
- Thanks.

414
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:37,992
- Good job, Mag.
- Thanks, Mom.

415
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,002
Do they need to do their
homework or something?

416
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,403
No. She's having fun.

417
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:52,638
Get these real good.

418
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:55,104
Shit the bed!

419
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,080
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

420
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:05,786
These are brand new pants.

421
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,186
- Hey, man...
- I'm sorry.

422
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:10,393
Chill out, man. She said she was sorry.

423
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,363
It's okay, Maggie. I think I
have something for you, okay?

424
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:14,591
- Just wait here.
- Do you have a bathroom...

425
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,396
No. Please don't bring
the paint in, okay?

426
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,506
- It's not that bad, man.
- Take it easy, man.

427
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,165
There's almost nothing on
you, man. You look fine.

428
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,836
That will come out. I mean, the
real major cleanup is the floor.

429
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,071
You're such a dick.

430
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,910
- Looks like it just grazed you.
- It doesn't look that bad.

431
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:35,785
You're right.

432
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:38,151
Let's hug it out.

433
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,053
- Hugs?
- What's he talking about?

434
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:41,659
- Hugs.
- What?

435
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:46,354
Stay away from the kid.
Stay away from the kid.

436
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:48,193
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

437
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:26,571
You have a lovely body, Owen.

438
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:30,998
Fuck me.

439
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:34,236
Do you work out?

440
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,316
Can I ask you where
you got your underwear?

441
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:41,283
Because they fit. They
fit perfectly like...

442
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:43,821
You guys are so fucking funny.

443
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,958
I'm asking you a serious
question, that's all.

444
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,489
These should all fit you.

445
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:50,653
All I need is a T-shirt and some pants.

446
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,161
Take it all.

447
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:54,629
I don't need all this.

448
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:03,298
She didn't have to give me all this.

449
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,736
Just take it all, man.

450
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:11,779
- I don't have to bring it back?
- Jesus. Are you listening? Take the clothes.

451
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,511
- I was just fucking asking.
- Take them.

452
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,748
Do you want to help your friend?

453
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,213
Now it's his turn.

454
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:58,293
- Stay strong, Private.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:44:02,868 --> 00:44:03,960
Fuck!

456
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,637
Don't give them anything!

457
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,535
Private!

458
00:44:11,911 --> 00:44:13,845
Your life depends on it!

459
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:14,911
Please.

460
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:23,421
Fuck! Motherfuckers! I
will fucking kill you!

461
00:44:25,024 --> 00:44:26,457
Christ!

462
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:31,485
<i>My name is Private Joe Willis. I'm
with the United States Marine Corps.</i>

463
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:34,963
I was told I was coming
here to fight for my country.

464
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:40,170
But now I realize that
Afghanistan belongs to its people.

465
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:43,573
<i>And we have no business being here.</i>

466
00:44:45,111 --> 00:44:46,840
<i>I love you, Cassie.</i>

467
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:51,114
<i>Joe Jr., your daddy always loves you.</i>

468
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:58,620
You have two daughters.

469
00:45:02,361 --> 00:45:04,329
Okay. Dad, get down.

470
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:05,429
- How's this?
- Perfect.

471
00:45:05,598 --> 00:45:08,226
- Great. Great.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

472
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:42,493
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

473
00:45:43,435 --> 00:45:44,527
Happy birthday!

474
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:47,829
- You like the kitchen?
- I love it.

475
00:45:47,973 --> 00:45:49,497
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

476
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:50,574
You're welcome.

477
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:52,771
Mom, this is from Deedee.

478
00:45:52,912 --> 00:45:54,846
- Thank you, Deedee.
- You're welcome.

479
00:45:55,281 --> 00:45:57,647
- Can I help you open it?
- Yes, please.

480
00:45:58,918 --> 00:46:00,146
- She looking now?
- No, she's opening the presents.

481
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:01,753
Good job on the kitchen.

482
00:46:02,388 --> 00:46:03,412
What did he just say to me?

483
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:05,581
He said you did a good
job on the kitchen.

484
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:06,957
Okay. Go, go.

485
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,010
Blow out the candles. Come on, come on.

486
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:32,943
Do it.

487
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:40,688
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

488
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,420
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Thank you.

489
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,567
Maggie? Maggie.

490
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:52,660
- No!
- Maggie, slow down.

491
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:54,568
Maggie, be careful.

492
00:46:58,711 --> 00:46:59,735
What are you doing?

493
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,938
I want to get to the ice before my mama.

494
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:04,481
Well, you better wait
for her, don't you think?

495
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:06,947
Everybody loves Maggie.

496
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,447
- Why do you say that?
- Because she's lovable.

497
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:20,693
You know, your dad saved me

498
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,301
in that water, right there,
when we were both kids.

499
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:27,500
You know, you're like your dad.

500
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:29,265
Am I?

501
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:35,072
Am I like my mom?

502
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:38,913
A spitting image, yeah.

503
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:44,215
Except you're yourself,
Isabelle. And everybody loves you.

504
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:46,151
Come on.

505
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:13,312
I did it!

506
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:21,484
I talked to her for over an hour.

507
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:27,247
She said to me that she hadn't
slept right in over three years.

508
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:32,592
She kept having these nightmares
that I would come back and shoot her.

509
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:37,799
I don't know.

510
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:43,465
I told her it was all right,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

511
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,010
She just started to cry.

512
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:53,518
Right there in the bank,
she just started to cry.

513
00:49:58,223 --> 00:49:59,918
And she thanked me.

514
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:06,758
She said that she felt like...

515
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,824
What did she say?

516
00:50:12,104 --> 00:50:14,072
Like she could breathe again.

517
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:19,338
And then she asked if I wanted
to open up a bank account.

518
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:20,410
No.

519
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:22,241
I swear to God.

520
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,440
- What did you do?
- I opened an account.

521
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:30,879
I'm proud of you.

522
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,425
I can't wait to start bouncing checks.

523
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:53,907
When I was like 17 or 18,

524
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:05,413
I used to listen to this song,
like, over and over again.

525
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:06,785
Me, too.

526
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:10,725
Really?

527
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,797
Why is that so surprising?

528
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,200
I don't know. I just...

529
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,773
I took you more for,
like, an 'NSync fan.

530
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,067
Fuck you.

531
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,143
Give me that.

532
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:28,473
- Really?
- Really.

533
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,152
You think I'm such a square.

534
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:47,329
I'm starting to reassess, Snoop Dogg.

535
00:51:53,972 --> 00:51:56,497
Just because I was a
cheerleader, it doesn't...

536
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,801
Yeah, and you dated a football player.

537
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:02,607
I am such a cliché.

538
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:11,852
You were kind of a pain in
the ass. You got to admit that.

539
00:52:12,024 --> 00:52:13,651
No, I wasn't.

540
00:52:14,526 --> 00:52:17,984
Guys always say that girls are
stuck up if they won't talk to them.

541
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,461
I just didn't like you.

542
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,159
You were always drunk and fighting...

543
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:04,502
I have to get some air.

544
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,246
Captain!

545
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:58,620
Captain!

546
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:41,759
Take it.

547
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:03,819
What do we do?

548
00:56:06,024 --> 00:56:08,015
He has no value for us.

549
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:12,590
Just a weight on our shoulder.

550
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,668
Waste of food and water.

551
00:56:19,905 --> 00:56:21,031
Kill him.

552
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,222
Pick it up.

553
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:47,026
You have family?

554
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:51,391
Do you want to see them again?

555
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,903
Pick up the pipe!

556
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,904
- Captain...
- It's you or him.

557
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:06,179
Kill him or I will kill you.

558
00:57:07,986 --> 00:57:11,820
Kill him! Kill him or
I will cut his head off!

559
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:13,456
Kill him! Kill him!

560
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,820
Kill him!

561
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,788
Kill him!

562
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:17,076
Shit.

563
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,560
I brought you some molding.

564
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:49,379
Hey, look, I don't want to
ruin anything, all right.

565
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:52,581
I just want to be able to
come over and see the girls.

566
00:58:52,757 --> 00:58:55,555
Please, I would love you
to come see the girls.

567
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:02,192
We just miss Sam.

568
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:05,827
Yeah.

569
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,374
That's Hank.

570
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:23,916
You still at it, huh?

571
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,388
Where did you ever learn to be so handy?

572
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:17,066
Cover there!

573
01:00:21,112 --> 01:00:23,171
Move forward. Moving forward!

574
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:24,611
Come on. Let's go.

575
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:29,211
Straight ahead!

576
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,221
- Stop right there!
- Get your hands up.

577
01:00:31,356 --> 01:00:33,085
Come to me. Come to me.

578
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:35,617
Come on. Get your hands up.

579
01:00:36,294 --> 01:00:38,956
Get your hands up. Right here. Get down.

580
01:00:43,368 --> 01:00:44,699
You a Marine?

581
01:00:48,406 --> 01:00:50,374
Cahill, is that your name?

582
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:52,442
Was there anyone else with you?

583
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,371
- Come on. Ready?
- Come on.

584
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,116
Get it on. Get it on.

585
01:01:03,822 --> 01:01:05,084
We need a nose.

586
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,715
- Mom, nose.
- Nose.

587
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:09,623
- Nose!
- Here.

588
01:01:09,761 --> 01:01:11,956
Get the nose. Get the nose.

589
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:16,297
He is looking hot, you guys.

590
01:01:18,103 --> 01:01:19,730
Can you teach them
how to throw snowballs?

591
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:21,532
Because they can't even hit me.

592
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,536
That one hit you.

593
01:01:27,512 --> 01:01:30,037
Maybe I should hit you
with a massive snowball.

594
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:32,643
Come on.

595
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:34,982
Izzie, Izzie, are you okay?

596
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,247
Izzie, Izzie. Hey, hey, hey.

597
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:39,288
- Are you okay?
- Grace.

598
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:41,891
Sucker! Sucker.

599
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:43,589
Get him! Get him!

600
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:48,598
Get him. Try and get him.

601
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:50,725
Hello?

602
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:52,930
Yes, this is she.

603
01:01:54,472 --> 01:01:56,440
See this cheater-pants over here.

604
01:01:57,242 --> 01:01:58,903
Come on. You freaked me out.

605
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:12,852
- What?
- Not me.

606
01:02:13,892 --> 01:02:16,087
It was him! Get up.

607
01:02:33,578 --> 01:02:35,443
Hey. What's going on?

608
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,646
- Uncle Tommy, she grabbed my hair.
- Okay.

609
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:40,910
I'm sorry. I want to keep playing.

610
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:42,246
Okay. What?

611
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:00,337
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

612
01:03:00,471 --> 01:03:03,929
- Why?
- Because we have to be patient. Okay?

613
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:09,312
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

614
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:10,573
Thanks.

615
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:20,652
Daddy!

616
01:03:22,026 --> 01:03:24,893
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

617
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:27,494
My babies.

618
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,759
I love you, honey.

619
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,407
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Sure.

620
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:23,578
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

621
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:26,450
Do you like it? Do you like it?

622
01:04:26,624 --> 01:04:29,422
Wow. It's amazing.

623
01:04:30,295 --> 01:04:31,421
I think he likes it.

624
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,154
- Who did it?
- Me.

625
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:36,391
- You did?
- And Uncle Tommy.

626
01:04:36,567 --> 01:04:38,660
Uncle Tommy and 'three amigos'.

627
01:05:05,296 --> 01:05:06,957
Are you tired, honey?

628
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:10,492
Come, get in bed. Everyone.

629
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:13,536
This is fun.

630
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,900
- I missed you, Daddy.
- Me, too.

631
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,072
My girls.

632
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:23,278
That's us, all right.

633
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,417
Can I get up, Mom?

634
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:39,826
Dad, it's not bedtime.

635
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:55,873
I locked that door.

636
01:05:57,448 --> 01:05:58,813
It's broken.

637
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:19,730
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

638
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,468
- Banged up well, huh?
- Yeah.

639
01:06:56,908 --> 01:06:59,638
Can't you take that
down to the mechanic?

640
01:07:01,946 --> 01:07:03,174
I got it.

641
01:07:04,382 --> 01:07:06,009
Nothing else to do.

642
01:07:08,986 --> 01:07:10,180
You okay?

643
01:07:11,956 --> 01:07:12,980
Yeah.

644
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:25,193
'Cause after I got back from Nam,
I couldn't talk to your mother.

645
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:32,209
I guess I took it out on
you and Tommy, you know, I...

646
01:07:33,077 --> 01:07:34,601
I don't know why.

647
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:42,241
Look, if you ever wanna
talk, let me know. All right?

648
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:08,503
You okay?

649
01:08:12,517 --> 01:08:13,848
You're good.

650
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:17,412
Better than I thought, yeah.

651
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:21,391
You look good out there with them.

652
01:08:30,668 --> 01:08:32,898
Thanks for taking care of them.

653
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,136
I didn't expect that.

654
01:08:35,273 --> 01:08:37,639
It just comes naturally, you know.

655
01:08:42,947 --> 01:08:45,472
It makes me start to think, you know.

656
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:55,558
Grace is something, huh?

657
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:01,021
Did you fuck her?

658
01:09:04,302 --> 01:09:04,927
What? You kidding?

659
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:09,172
I'd understand.

660
01:09:11,642 --> 01:09:14,008
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

661
01:09:15,646 --> 01:09:16,908
Tommy,

662
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:19,643
I could forgive you.

663
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:32,321
What's going on in your head?

664
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:36,092
What's making you think that?

665
01:09:40,338 --> 01:09:44,900
You guys just look like two
teenagers in love out there.

666
01:09:46,677 --> 01:09:47,939
All right.

667
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,775
I mean, you know?

668
01:09:52,016 --> 01:09:53,711
You can't deny that.

669
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,124
You can tell me.

670
01:10:12,803 --> 01:10:14,668
You gotta tell me. You understand?

671
01:10:15,706 --> 01:10:17,970
- I know you slept in my house.
- Sam. Sam...

672
01:10:18,109 --> 01:10:21,044
Hey, don't bullshit me.

673
01:10:38,162 --> 01:10:39,857
Joe Jr., come back.

674
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,291
Cassie, he's fine.

675
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:48,694
Ever since his dad died, I
can't let him out of my sight.

676
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:52,469
Look at him. He's got a mind of his own.

677
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:57,538
I have this nightmare where
Joe is looking up at me,

678
01:10:58,416 --> 01:10:59,678
and he's trying to tell me something.

679
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:02,615
He's trying to talk
to me, but the teeth,

680
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:06,621
his teeth just fall out of
his mouth and there is blood,

681
01:11:08,826 --> 01:11:12,159
and I'm scrabbling
around picking them up.

682
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:16,798
And then last night,
your husband was there.

683
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:19,930
And he looks at my hand,
and he takes my hand,

684
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:22,505
and he looks at my wedding
ring and he just smiles at me.

685
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,906
- Did he say anything?
- No. He just smiled.

686
01:11:31,716 --> 01:11:34,480
In the dream, I hated
him for being alive.

687
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:39,113
That's why I came over
to apologize. I'm sorry.

688
01:11:40,524 --> 01:11:44,620
I'm sick of feeling like this all
the time. I want to forgive them.

689
01:11:44,795 --> 01:11:47,161
I want to be able to forgive them.

690
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:53,534
Poor Joe Jr.

691
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:56,232
He knows.

692
01:11:57,441 --> 01:12:01,172
He's just like his daddy. He
knows exactly what I'm thinking.

693
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:09,084
Where are you going, huh?

694
01:12:12,523 --> 01:12:14,047
- Sam.
- Hi.

695
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:17,956
Did you see him die?

696
01:12:21,932 --> 01:12:22,864
No.

697
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:25,731
Did you hear anything?

698
01:12:26,704 --> 01:12:28,672
I mean, was he on his own?

699
01:12:30,374 --> 01:12:32,501
He was brave. I know that.

700
01:12:35,346 --> 01:12:37,177
That's Captain Cahill.

701
01:12:38,115 --> 01:12:40,515
He was friends with your daddy.

702
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:43,984
Wave. Are you gonna
wave? Are you gonna wave?

703
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,548
You're a good man.

704
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:51,220
Baby, where are you going? Come here.

705
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,454
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Send him in.

706
01:14:27,858 --> 01:14:29,689
I want to go back, sir.

707
01:14:30,794 --> 01:14:32,921
I'm ready. Need to see my men.

708
01:14:34,098 --> 01:14:36,123
How's the counseling going?

709
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:38,296
Yeah. I saw Thompson.

710
01:14:39,537 --> 01:14:44,736
Everything pretty good there and,
you know, just thinking about my men

711
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,901
and want to get back.

712
01:14:48,045 --> 01:14:49,342
That's good.

713
01:14:50,814 --> 01:14:52,441
How's the family?

714
01:14:56,053 --> 01:14:57,884
I can't be there, sir.

715
01:14:58,422 --> 01:14:59,446
Yeah?

716
01:15:01,492 --> 01:15:03,289
They don't understand.

717
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:08,287
You know, I mean, nobody understands.

718
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,835
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.

719
01:15:13,837 --> 01:15:15,702
You've been through a lot of shit.

720
01:15:17,241 --> 01:15:19,141
So has your family.

721
01:15:19,276 --> 01:15:20,937
I don't mind Brian.

722
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:25,812
He never hits people, only
the boys, but not the girls.

723
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,645
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

724
01:15:28,252 --> 01:15:32,655
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name, though.

725
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:34,017
Elephant?

726
01:15:38,562 --> 01:15:40,291
An elephant's not a dog.

727
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:42,893
I know an elephant's not a dog.

728
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:44,295
Then why did you say it?

729
01:15:44,435 --> 01:15:48,701
Because elephants have big
ears and so does his dog.

730
01:15:48,839 --> 01:15:54,334
So, big ears, get it?

731
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:57,474
It's really funny if
you think about it, Dad.

732
01:15:57,715 --> 01:15:58,773
Sam, relax.

733
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:00,611
But how is it funny?

734
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:02,879
Big ears.

735
01:16:17,768 --> 01:16:22,831
- Is Dad okay, Mom?
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

736
01:16:24,608 --> 01:16:26,235
When is Uncle Tommy coming?

737
01:16:26,377 --> 01:16:28,242
- He's coming soon, sweetie, okay?
- Okay.

738
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:30,347
He wants to play with you.

739
01:16:31,548 --> 01:16:32,879
- Okay?
- Okay.

740
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:36,510
- I'm gonna go check on Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

741
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,529
Sammy, what happened?

742
01:16:52,836 --> 01:16:54,394
What's going on?

743
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:56,803
Talk to me.

744
01:16:58,642 --> 01:17:00,075
What happened?

745
01:17:01,712 --> 01:17:03,612
What did they do to you?

746
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:07,947
What happened with you and Tommy?

747
01:17:21,565 --> 01:17:23,294
We kissed. That's it.

748
01:17:26,203 --> 01:17:27,602
I missed you.

749
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:30,672
I thought you were dead.

750
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:34,177
I couldn't get out of bed.

751
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,377
That's it.

752
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:49,150
- You told me the truth?
- You know.

753
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:56,296
Now tell me.

754
01:18:14,885 --> 01:18:17,012
I think you're fucking Tommy.

755
01:18:17,821 --> 01:18:18,947
Sam...

756
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:09,600
Come on, come on. Faster. Faster.

757
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,600
Why did you stop pulling?

758
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:18,170
Hey.

759
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,742
You girls playing?

760
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:28,190
What's wrong?

761
01:19:34,932 --> 01:19:36,194
It's okay.

762
01:19:41,138 --> 01:19:42,833
I was just confused.

763
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:47,737
It's gonna be okay.

764
01:19:49,213 --> 01:19:51,875
Come here. Give me a hug.

765
01:19:53,116 --> 01:19:56,813
Now. Those are my girls.

766
01:20:04,928 --> 01:20:08,329
Why did the girl blush when
she opened the refrigerator?

767
01:20:08,498 --> 01:20:11,990
- She saw the salad dressing.
- She saw the salad dressing.

768
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:13,901
I told you guys that one?

769
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:16,864
A thousand times.

770
01:20:17,007 --> 01:20:18,941
It's still funny, though.

771
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:24,241
Have fun.

772
01:20:50,474 --> 01:20:52,169
Where have you been?

773
01:20:52,542 --> 01:20:56,308
I was outside

774
01:20:57,447 --> 01:21:03,909
just thinking and...

775
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:14,886
I was just thinking
about you and the kids

776
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:19,934
and the sun came up and I thought,

777
01:21:21,905 --> 01:21:23,839
I'm so lucky to be alive.

778
01:21:44,995 --> 01:21:47,793
We're gonna be late. Come on.

779
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:49,364
Do you have a spelling test today?

780
01:21:49,499 --> 01:21:53,333
Come on, Grandpa. It's my
birthday. It's my birthday!

781
01:21:58,275 --> 01:22:01,142
Can I open my presents now? Please.

782
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:02,870
I think we should wait.

783
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:04,037
Wait for Uncle Tommy.

784
01:22:04,181 --> 01:22:08,811
- Pretty please.
- Well, let her open just one. It won't hurt.

785
01:22:09,419 --> 01:22:12,547
- You can open Grandpa's.
- Thank you.

786
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:13,985
Just one.

787
01:22:14,157 --> 01:22:16,421
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

788
01:22:16,593 --> 01:22:18,151
Is it the big one?

789
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:20,153
It's Uncle Tommy!

790
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:21,354
Let's guess.

791
01:22:27,971 --> 01:22:28,995
Izzie.

792
01:22:29,139 --> 01:22:30,436
- Hey.
- Hey.

793
01:22:33,143 --> 01:22:34,735
What's the matter?

794
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:37,603
Is she okay?

795
01:22:38,382 --> 01:22:41,215
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Tina.

796
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:42,750
- I'm Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

797
01:22:42,886 --> 01:22:44,786
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

798
01:22:44,921 --> 01:22:47,048
We're all in the dining room.

799
01:22:49,192 --> 01:22:51,683
Oh, my God. She's so pretty.

800
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:02,795
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

801
01:23:03,607 --> 01:23:05,040
This is Tina.

802
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:08,572
She's an old friend.

803
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:12,572
Actually, we just met an hour ago.

804
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:16,041
Yeah. It was like an hour and a half.

805
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,281
You got quite a charmer here.

806
01:23:20,724 --> 01:23:23,852
It hides inside its shell

807
01:23:24,027 --> 01:23:28,589
putting its head in the
shell and its arms and legs

808
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:31,500
and its little tiny tail.

809
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:35,630
And when the thing that's
scaring him goes like this,

810
01:23:36,773 --> 01:23:38,638
the turtle doesn't come out.

811
01:23:38,775 --> 01:23:43,906
So, the thing that scares
the turtle goes away

812
01:23:44,047 --> 01:23:45,810
'cause it thinks it's a rock.

813
01:23:45,949 --> 01:23:47,746
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy birthday.

814
01:23:47,884 --> 01:23:49,283
Yes, you are.

815
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:54,749
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

816
01:23:54,925 --> 01:23:56,415
Everyone's different, Dad, you know.

817
01:23:56,593 --> 01:23:58,618
- Stop playing with your cake.
- What do you mean?

818
01:23:58,795 --> 01:24:04,062
I just think it's necessary that
everybody has someone to listen to them.

819
01:24:04,201 --> 01:24:08,695
Right, you know, these days they
need therapy if they stub their toe.

820
01:24:09,339 --> 01:24:12,331
These guys are Marines.
They're trained for it.

821
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:16,340
They're Marines, but
they're still people,

822
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,385
and I don't think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody.

823
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:23,679
What do you think they are trained for?

824
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:28,814
I think that they're... What?
They're trained to use deadly force...

825
01:24:29,259 --> 01:24:31,227
- Trained to kill. ...but
nobody can really be trained

826
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:32,759
to watch someone die.

827
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:36,593
That's just something
that you're not taught.

828
01:24:36,733 --> 01:24:37,722
Hey.

829
01:24:40,837 --> 01:24:44,773
Isabelle, let it go.

830
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:46,739
Please. Thank you.

831
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,405
So, what do you do?

832
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,074
- I'm going to be a nurse.
- Hey!

833
01:24:53,216 --> 01:24:56,185
- I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

834
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:58,116
- Dad?
- Isabelle.

835
01:24:59,389 --> 01:25:00,913
That's my kitty.

836
01:25:01,091 --> 01:25:03,491
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a nurse, sir.

837
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:06,628
- Need a nurse?
- Let you know if I do.

838
01:25:06,763 --> 01:25:08,594
Maggie gets everything.

839
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:12,300
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

840
01:25:12,435 --> 01:25:15,563
I didn't get anything that
I wanted on my birthday.

841
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:19,407
And you were in stupid Afghanistan.

842
01:25:24,748 --> 01:25:27,216
Nursing. How's nursing
been for you, Tina?

843
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,147
It's been a challenge.

844
01:25:29,653 --> 01:25:33,214
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

845
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,952
Where did you grow up, Tina?

846
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,961
Just 20 miles south. Actually,
I've never really left.

847
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,758
So... I'm gonna change that, though.

848
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:44,930
I'm living at home right now which...

849
01:25:45,068 --> 01:25:48,504
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time,

850
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,803
which is good, it helps me
save money for school and stuff.

851
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:56,276
- RN?
- An RN, yeah.

852
01:25:57,747 --> 01:26:00,409
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

853
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,609
Isabelle, we're trying to
listen to our guest, all right?

854
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,777
So you're in eight-hour
shifts, 12-hour...

855
01:26:04,921 --> 01:26:09,756
Now I am praying for 12-hour
shifts. I have to get...

856
01:26:09,893 --> 01:26:12,726
Student loans are killing me.

857
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:15,460
I don't know how anyone
does it. How did you do it?

858
01:26:15,599 --> 01:26:16,793
Isabelle.

859
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:22,029
Stop it.

860
01:26:22,172 --> 01:26:23,935
What got you into it?

861
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:28,468
I genuinely like people and I love...

862
01:26:28,778 --> 01:26:30,871
I might as well like it.

863
01:26:31,047 --> 01:26:32,139
Enough!

864
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,311
Couldn't you just stay dead?

865
01:26:36,453 --> 01:26:37,420
Isabelle!

866
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:40,489
You're just mad 'cause Mom would
rather sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

867
01:26:40,657 --> 01:26:42,557
Isabelle! Why would you say that?

868
01:26:42,692 --> 01:26:44,990
Mom and Uncle Tommy
had sex all the time.

869
01:26:45,128 --> 01:26:46,254
Enough!

870
01:27:13,023 --> 01:27:14,615
Can I go home now?

871
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:17,517
I wanna go to bed.

872
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:38,978
Sorry, Mom.

873
01:27:45,822 --> 01:27:48,689
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

874
01:27:51,995 --> 01:27:53,553
I don't like Dad.

875
01:27:56,099 --> 01:28:00,331
I'd rather have Uncle
Tommy around instead of Dad.

876
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:03,131
Me, too.

877
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:09,204
Daddy's gonna be better, okay?

878
01:28:10,613 --> 01:28:12,774
- Really?
- Yeah.

879
01:28:15,552 --> 01:28:16,883
Thanks, Mom.

880
01:28:20,457 --> 01:28:24,018
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

881
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:52,149
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

882
01:28:55,558 --> 01:28:57,219
Where are you going?

883
01:28:59,896 --> 01:29:01,887
It's none of your damn
business, you know.

884
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:06,562
Just stay the hell out of it.

885
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:10,030
You gotta call the police, Hank.

886
01:29:21,684 --> 01:29:23,117
What is that?

887
01:29:27,123 --> 01:29:29,717
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

888
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:35,063
- They all tucked in?
- Yeah.

889
01:29:37,133 --> 01:29:38,725
Say their prayers?

890
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:42,803
Good.

891
01:29:47,811 --> 01:29:48,835
Sam?

892
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,469
Sam?

893
01:29:53,883 --> 01:29:56,317
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

894
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,640
- You know what I did to get back to you?
- No.

895
01:30:21,778 --> 01:30:25,236
You know what I did to
fucking get back to you?

896
01:30:25,748 --> 01:30:27,807
You fucking bitch!

897
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:32,351
You know how he fucking suffered?

898
01:30:32,489 --> 01:30:34,821
He fucking suffered because of you!

899
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:39,394
And what have you done to my fucking
house and my fucking kids, Grace?

900
01:30:39,562 --> 01:30:41,894
- You're fucking my brother.
- Sam, you know I didn't.

901
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:44,895
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

902
01:30:45,034 --> 01:30:46,797
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

903
01:30:46,936 --> 01:30:49,905
- Please, our girls, please.
- You know how much I love you?

904
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,209
You know what I... Grace,
do you know what I fucking...

905
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:59,981
You know what I had to do with
these fucking hands, Grace?

906
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,316
You... Fuck!

907
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:07,750
God, fuck!

908
01:31:11,895 --> 01:31:13,795
What are you doing here?

909
01:31:29,345 --> 01:31:30,573
Come on, man.

910
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:50,961
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
- What are you fucking doing?

911
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,192
Go to your room.

912
01:31:52,335 --> 01:31:54,360
- Fuck. What are you doing, Tommy?
- Okay.

913
01:31:54,504 --> 01:31:57,200
- What the fuck are you doing to me?
- Girls, lock the door.

914
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,240
Behind my fucking back!

915
01:32:01,144 --> 01:32:03,044
- Did you call the cops?
- Hold on.

916
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,943
- Did you call the fucking cops?
- All right. All right. All right.

917
01:32:19,929 --> 01:32:21,794
Is there a disturbance?

918
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:26,900
Hold back.

919
01:32:27,036 --> 01:32:28,298
What are you doing here?

920
01:32:28,438 --> 01:32:29,928
- Drop your weapon.
- What are you doing?

921
01:32:30,073 --> 01:32:32,871
- Hold on. Put your gun down.
- Tommy, go back in the house.

922
01:32:33,009 --> 01:32:36,206
- What are you doing, huh?
- Put your weapon down, Captain.

923
01:32:36,346 --> 01:32:37,278
You know me?

924
01:32:37,413 --> 01:32:38,675
- Just shut up for a second, okay?
- You know me, huh?

925
01:32:38,815 --> 01:32:41,010
- I know your father, sir.
- Stay back!

926
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:43,380
- Stay back!
- All right. All right. All right.

927
01:32:43,519 --> 01:32:46,010
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero!

928
01:32:46,155 --> 01:32:48,623
I'm no fucking hero!
You know what I've done?

929
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:51,089
- Hey, it's all right. Sam!
- Just relax.

930
01:32:51,227 --> 01:32:52,353
- Sam!
- Put the gun down, Sam.

931
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:54,519
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

932
01:32:54,697 --> 01:32:55,994
You gonna shoot me?

933
01:32:56,132 --> 01:32:57,360
- Put the gun down!
- Sam!

934
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,264
- Fucking shoot me! Shoot me!
- Hold your fire. Nobody shoot!

935
01:33:00,403 --> 01:33:01,927
Shoot me! Come on!

936
01:33:02,071 --> 01:33:05,905
Jesus, shut the fuck up! This
is a family matter. Shut up!

937
01:33:06,042 --> 01:33:07,441
Shut up. He's my brother.

938
01:33:07,577 --> 01:33:09,135
- Just stop for a second.
- Put the gun down, sir.

939
01:33:09,278 --> 01:33:12,270
- Just let me talk to him. He's my brother.
- Give him a minute.

940
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,152
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

941
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,114
Sam!

942
01:33:32,702 --> 01:33:36,900
You're my brother. You're my family.

943
01:33:41,244 --> 01:33:42,711
Do you hear me?

944
01:33:45,348 --> 01:33:46,542
Sam!

945
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:06,164
What's going on, Sam?

946
01:34:08,304 --> 01:34:09,999
I'm drowning, Tommy.

947
01:34:16,412 --> 01:34:18,437
Go. Go, go. Get on the ground!

948
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:20,644
- Gun clear. Get down.
- Get on the ground now!

949
01:34:20,783 --> 01:34:21,977
Get down!

950
01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:24,086
- Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

951
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:28,884
On your knees. On your knees.

952
01:34:31,594 --> 01:34:32,891
Get him up.

953
01:36:12,495 --> 01:36:14,087
<i>My darling Grace,</i>

954
01:36:16,032 --> 01:36:20,401
<i>if you're reading this, it
means I didn't make it back.</i>

955
01:36:22,605 --> 01:36:24,869
<i>Nothing is certain in this life.</i>

956
01:36:26,709 --> 01:36:32,147
<i>The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you and our girls.</i>

957
01:36:34,517 --> 01:36:36,644
<i>That is the only thing I know.</i>

958
01:36:46,128 --> 01:36:50,030
- Hello?
- Hey, Tommy. It's Sam.

959
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:51,690
Hey.

960
01:36:56,372 --> 01:37:01,776
I was just thinking about you.

961
01:37:02,879 --> 01:37:05,905
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

962
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:10,079
Just calling. Yeah.

963
01:37:14,724 --> 01:37:16,658
You're my brother, Tommy.

964
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:33,408
When is your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

965
01:37:56,365 --> 01:37:59,698
Okay, sir. You know the drill.
We'll see you in about 30 minutes.

966
01:38:32,802 --> 01:38:34,531
Sam, tell me what happened.

967
01:38:42,745 --> 01:38:47,045
Sam, what happened?

968
01:38:50,853 --> 01:38:53,117
Why are you punishing yourself?

969
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:10,799
I've loved you since I was 16 years old.

970
01:39:11,807 --> 01:39:13,240
You know that?

971
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:17,702
If you don't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

972
01:39:42,738 --> 01:39:44,137
I killed him.

973
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,175
I killed Joe Willis.

974
01:40:06,529 --> 01:40:10,431
<i>I don't know who said, "Only the
dead have seen the end of war."</i>

975
01:40:12,835 --> 01:40:14,860
<i>I have seen the end of war.</i>

976
01:40:17,573 --> 01:40:23,034
<i>The question is, can I live again?</i>
