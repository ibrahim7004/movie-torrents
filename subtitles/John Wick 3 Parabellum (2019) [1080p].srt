1
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:36,108
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,021
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:34,151
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

4
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,369
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

5
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,717
And killed a man on
company grounds, Charon.

6
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,804
Do you expect him
to make it out?

7
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,630
$14 million bounty
on his head.

8
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:46,412
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

9
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,890
I'd say the odds
are about even.

10
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,369
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

11
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,890
No way!

12
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,674
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

13
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,717
But I know better, man.

14
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,543
I know better.
I know what I'm...

15
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,064
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

16
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,500
Tick tock.

17
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,717
Tick tock.

18
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,108
Tick tock. Tick...

19
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,325
No time to dilly
dally, Mr. Wick!

20
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,890
The New York Public Library.

21
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:53,934
You got it.

22
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:14,760
Change of plan.

23
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:19,238
To the Continental.

24
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,977
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

25
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,630
Yes sir, Mr. Wick.

26
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:29,369
Good dog. Good dog.

27
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,412
John Wick, Excommunicado.

28
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,456
In effect, 20 minutes.

29
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,500
Can I help you?

30
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:08,543
Russian Folktale.
Alexander Afanasyev.

31
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,543
1864.

32
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,325
- Level two.
- Thank you.

33
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,629
"Consider your origins.

34
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,587
"You were not made
to live as brutes,

35
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,803
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge."

36
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,369
Dante.

37
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:36,064
Looking a little run
down there, John.

38
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,803
Ernest. I still have time.

39
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:42,238
It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

40
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:44,412
You sure this is
what you wanna do?

41
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,282
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

42
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,412
Not if you can't spend it.

43
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,934
John Wick, Excommunicado.

44
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:38,238
In effect, 10 minutes.

45
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,673
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

46
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:56,412
No help, no services
of any kind.

47
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,021
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

48
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:13,934
Mr. Wick.

49
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,369
No, no. You shouldn't be
here. Hour's almost up.

50
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,064
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

51
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:19,542
No! I can't.

52
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,195
I still have five minutes!

53
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,760
Please.

54
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,673
Come on. Come on.

55
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,499
All right, sit there.

56
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,499
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

57
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,325
Puncture wound.

58
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:55,411
Went deep. Nicked the artery.

59
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,151
Here you go.

60
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:01,369
All right.

61
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,934
John Wick, Excommunicado.

62
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,977
In effect, one minute.

63
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:23,238
Doc?

64
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:28,934
Doc?

65
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:30,716
Yeah. We're halfway there.

66
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,195
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

67
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,542
John Wick, Excommunicado.

68
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:42,282
In effect, in five, four...

69
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,847
three, two...

70
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,760
...one.

71
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,890
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

72
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,542
I know. Rules.

73
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,411
Ah, rules.

74
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,368
John Wick, 14 million.

75
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,586
Open contract is
now in effect.

76
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,108
All services are suspended.

77
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,586
And away we go.

78
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,716
Top shelf. On the right.

79
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,108
Yeah. Take four.

80
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:18,890
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

81
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,890
Mr. Wick?

82
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,803
They'll never believe I
stopped on the hour.

83
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,499
But you did.

84
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,977
They'll know.

85
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,368
Know what?

86
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,586
I told you where
the medicine was.

87
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:59,281
Where? Here.

88
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,542
Just below my floating rib.

89
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,716
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

90
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,281
Oh, wait!

91
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,151
One may not be enough.

92
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,108
Yeah. All right.

93
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,890
Be sure not to graze my...

94
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:27,934
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

95
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,368
Thanks, Doc.

96
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:12,020
John Wick. Open contract.

97
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:14,499
Increase, 15 million.

98
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:19,455
Where are you going,
Jonathan?

99
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,020
We are closed.

100
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:31,498
Jardani. Why have
you come home?

101
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,498
You present this to
me like an answer.

102
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,715
I still have my ticket.

103
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:46,324
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

104
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,672
you think your ticket is valid?

105
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:52,759
You forget that the Ruska Roma
is bound by the High Table,

106
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:56,107
and the High Table
stands above all?

107
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,411
They could kill me just
for talking to you.

108
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:04,933
You honor me by bringing
death to my front door.

109
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:11,020
Oh Jardani, what has
become of you?

110
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:31,281
You are bound...

111
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:33,715
And I am owed.

112
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,846
Rooney, enough!

113
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:14,281
"You are owed." You are
owed nothing, Jardani.

114
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:18,237
You know, when my pupils first come
here, they wish for one thing.

115
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,672
A life free of suffering.

116
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,454
I try to dissuade them from
these childish notions.

117
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:27,933
But as you know, art is pain.

118
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,454
Life is suffering.

119
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,672
Somehow, you managed
to get out.

120
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,020
But here you are, back
where you began.

121
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:47,194
All of this, for what?

122
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,323
Sit.

123
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:51,759
Even if I wanted to, I can't
help you, Jardani.

124
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:55,020
The High Table
wants your life.

125
00:29:55,802 --> 00:29:58,628
How can you fight
the wind?

126
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,367
How can you smash
the mountains?

127
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,933
How can you bury
the ocean?

128
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,585
How can you escape
from the light?

129
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:08,280
Of course, you can
go to the dark.

130
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,323
But they're in the dark, too.

131
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:17,846
So tell me, Jardani. What
do you really want?

132
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,759
Passage.

133
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,541
Where did you want to go?

134
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,236
Casablanca.

135
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:33,280
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

136
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,150
So be it.

137
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:43,933
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

138
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:47,280
If that's what you
really desire.

139
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:30,193
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

140
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:41,802
You can never
come home again.

141
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:45,498
Take him to the lifeboat.

142
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,323
Do svidaniya.

143
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,107
Do svidaniya.

144
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:27,020
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

145
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:50,149
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

146
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,062
Very well, sir.

147
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:58,280
The manager is
in the lounge.

148
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,933
I presume you're here
to discuss John Wick.

149
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:09,498
If that's so, we can
make this short.

150
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:13,106
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

151
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,541
And that's the all of it.

152
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:16,933
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

153
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:19,280
Oh, yes.

154
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:21,454
And I haven't got the slightest
idea where he is...

155
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:22,628
You're mistaken.

156
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,541
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

157
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,106
I'm here because Mr. Wick broke
the rules in this hotel.

158
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:28,541
The blood was spilt

159
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,846
on the grounds of the
Continental. Was it not?

160
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,062
Oh, yes.

161
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:36,280
As a matter of fact, the body gets
colder within these very walls.

162
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:38,541
I'd like to see it.

163
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:09,323
Santino D'Antonio.

164
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,498
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

165
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:15,541
slain by Mr. Wick while seeking
sanctuary in the Continental.

166
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:23,367
With a .45 ACP, it appears.

167
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,280
I had no control over
Mr. Wick's actions.

168
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:29,149
And yet, he lives because
you deemed it so, yes?

169
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:31,193
Yes.

170
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,367
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

171
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,498
It might even be fair to
call you friends, yes?

172
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,975
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

173
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,889
you stood by and
let him walk away

174
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,410
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

175
00:34:43,454 --> 00:34:45,454
I made him Excommunicado.

176
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,410
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

177
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,019
He broke the rules
in <i>my</i> hotel.

178
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,585
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

179
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:55,062
Where is your fealty?

180
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,280
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

181
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:59,454
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

182
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,236
Everything is under the Table.

183
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,889
I understand that you
have your loyalties,

184
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:04,323
but this cannot
be overlooked.

185
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,889
Let me be clear. I am
here to adjudge you.

186
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:09,541
You have one week to get
your affairs in order.

187
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,323
Excuse me?

188
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:15,149
At such time, your successor
will be named.

189
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:20,236
There are rules, they are the
only things that separate us...

190
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,628
- From the animals.
- Yes.

191
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,498
You have seven days.

192
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,541
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

193
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:34,367
you may look for me in room 217.

194
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,454
Enjoy your stay at
the Continental.

195
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:52,975
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

196
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:10,280
Welcome to my Mission Control.

197
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:13,672
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

198
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,019
From whence I control
the word on the street,

199
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,280
the way of the world.

200
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,672
With pigeons.

201
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:22,672
Yes. You see rats with wings
but I see the Internet.

202
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,845
No IP addresses. No
digital footprint.

203
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:31,585
Can't track it, can't hack
it, can't trace it.

204
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:34,367
Can you get disease from it?

205
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,759
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

206
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,845
What the hell do you want?

207
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,802
I wanted to see where
it didn't happen.

208
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,541
Where what didn't happen?

209
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,323
Where you didn't
kill John Wick.

210
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,845
I've always been
under the impression

211
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:50,759
that contracts and executing
them was optional.

212
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,802
I have no problem
with John Wick.

213
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:02,585
And yet, you gave John a
seven-round Kimber 1911,

214
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:05,506
knowing that he intended to use
it to stand against the Table.

215
00:37:05,507 --> 00:37:06,106
Yes?

216
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,323
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

217
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:22,498
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

218
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,280
the High Table is giving
you seven days.

219
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:27,628
Seven days for what, exactly?

220
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:31,410
To settle your affairs and find
a new home for your birds.

221
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:33,888
In seven days, you
abdicate your throne.

222
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:47,672
Oh, my dear.

223
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:50,236
Tell me, do you know what the
Bowery is, Adjudicator?

224
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,845
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

225
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:56,323
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

226
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,888
Because I am the throne, baby.

227
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:01,106
I am the Bowery!

228
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:04,585
I am all that you
deign not to look at

229
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:06,062
when you walk down
the street at night.

230
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:09,932
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

231
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:16,193
Do not make the mistake of thinking you
exist outside the rules, no men do.

232
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:18,019
You have seven days.

233
00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:59,367
Enough!

234
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,801
I'm afraid our friend
here is off limits.

235
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:10,758
But he's Excommunicado.

236
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:13,498
It seems the manager has
granted him amnesty.

237
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:19,193
Mr. Jonathan, would you be
so kind as to come with me?

238
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,410
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

239
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:44,454
Thanks.

240
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:52,410
Mr. Jonathan, it has been a
long time since our fine city

241
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:54,193
has been graced with
your presence.

242
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,019
I need to talk to...

243
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,280
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

244
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:09,062
My, my, welcome to the
Moroccan Continental.

245
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,975
I hope you'll find
it to your taste.

246
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,193
Right this way.

247
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:17,062
Ms. Al-Azwar, she
waits for no man.

248
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:25,758
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

249
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,236
You a dog person, John?

250
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,323
Sofia?

251
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:11,627
Sofia!

252
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,149
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

253
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:17,280
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

254
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,497
Nice suit.

255
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,627
Good to see you, too.

256
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:26,149
I should shoot you in
the head right now.

257
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:27,584
I know.

258
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,845
Don't you do it.

259
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:38,671
You're Excommunicado, John.

260
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:43,323
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

261
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:50,454
This is your blood.

262
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,627
Your bond.

263
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:58,410
When you needed help,
I was there.

264
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,453
Sit.

265
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:13,801
I was talking to you, John.

266
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,845
You do realize that I'm
management now, right?

267
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:24,758
I'm not service anymore, John.

268
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,497
So I don't go around shooting
people in the head.

269
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,019
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

270
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:33,497
I just need you to
get me to him.

271
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,193
- To who?
- Your old boss.

272
00:43:38,193 --> 00:43:39,627
You want to kill Berrada.

273
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,671
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

274
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:44,280
What could he possibly
give to you?

275
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:48,367
Guidance.

276
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:53,193
Look, I made a deal when I
agreed to run this hotel.

277
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:57,367
And that deal said that I had to
follow the rules of the Table.

278
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,627
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

279
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,280
and then probably me too, for
walking you up in there.

280
00:44:04,323 --> 00:44:07,975
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

281
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:12,801
Maybe somebody goes looking
for my daughter.

282
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:17,367
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

283
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:22,845
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

284
00:44:24,975 --> 00:44:27,236
Do you wanna know
where she is?

285
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:31,193
No. I don't ever wanna know.

286
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:34,106
Because I don't trust that
I won't go find her.

287
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:39,540
A part of me longs for her.

288
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:43,540
And I have to kill that
part of myself every day,

289
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,149
just to keep her safe.

290
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:55,540
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

291
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,280
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

292
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:02,453
That's why I'm sitting here right
now and that's why I'm fucked!

293
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:10,106
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

294
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,801
Consequences.

295
00:45:15,888 --> 00:45:18,019
I'm just asking you to try.

296
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:20,714
Either way, you and me...

297
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:22,888
...we'll be even.

298
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,236
No.

299
00:45:36,497 --> 00:45:42,062
After this, we are
less than even.

300
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,932
We leave in 10 minutes.

301
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,106
How can I help you?

302
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,888
I wasn't expecting the
High Table so soon.

303
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:05,322
There is a task.

304
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,758
It involves someone who broke the
rules and stood against the Table.

305
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,932
John Wick, you mean.

306
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:14,888
My students have
not been idle.

307
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,192
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

308
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,322
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

309
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,975
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

310
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:25,453
A dog, a car.

311
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:27,497
I'm familiar.

312
00:47:30,845 --> 00:47:32,497
And I'm interested.

313
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:34,975
Very.

314
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:44,497
Blowfish. Very fatal.

315
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,497
No soy.

316
00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:02,671
I have served, I will
be of service.

317
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:45,453
Stop!

318
00:49:51,975 --> 00:49:53,061
Out!

319
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:03,061
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

320
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:06,148
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

321
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:07,366
He had a ticket.

322
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:09,888
But a ticket does not
stand above the Table.

323
00:50:09,932 --> 00:50:12,801
Your penance will
be paid in blood.

324
00:50:13,453 --> 00:50:14,453
Now...

325
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:21,758
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

326
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:35,322
I have served, I will
be of service.

327
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:00,148
We're not going in
like the old days.

328
00:51:01,018 --> 00:51:03,540
It's just a conversation.

329
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:07,409
Nothing's ever just a
conversation with you, John.

330
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:12,671
Let's go.

331
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:38,584
Sofia.

332
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:41,366
Always so nice to see you.

333
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:45,105
And the dogs, of course, how
marvelous. May I pet one?

334
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:47,235
Certainly.

335
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,235
Fantastic.

336
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:56,627
Jonathan Wick.

337
00:51:56,671 --> 00:51:59,758
I had heard you had made
your way to our shores.

338
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,322
Come along now.

339
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:09,322
I am certain we have
much to discuss.

340
00:52:13,888 --> 00:52:18,366
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

341
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,148
Tell me.

342
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:23,105
Do you come here to kill me?

343
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,497
No.

344
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:40,018
Mr. Wick, do you know where the
word "assassin" comes from?

345
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:45,061
People argue. "Assassin".

346
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,235
Hashasheen, followers
of Hassan-i.

347
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:54,322
Eaters of hashish.

348
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,148
No, thank you.

349
00:52:58,627 --> 00:53:02,018
But others contend it
comes from "asāsiyyūn".

350
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:06,366
Meaning, "men who are faithful
and who abide by their beliefs".

351
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:10,714
You see that coin?

352
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:14,279
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

353
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:17,671
Next to it, the first marker.

354
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:20,279
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

355
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,887
Now, this coin of course, it does
not represent monetary value.

356
00:53:24,931 --> 00:53:28,061
It represents the commerce
of relationships,

357
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,453
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

358
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,279
Order and rules.

359
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,192
You have broken the rules.

360
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:40,409
The High Table has
marked you for death.

361
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:42,453
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

362
00:53:42,497 --> 00:53:46,453
when your life has been by
your own actions, forfeit?

363
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,453
I seek to make amends.

364
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:56,627
To pay for what I've done.

365
00:53:56,671 --> 00:54:00,366
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

366
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,627
This dog, I do so love it.

367
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:11,584
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

368
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:16,540
Occasionally.

369
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:19,800
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

370
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:21,340
And if he wants me dead...

371
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:24,758
Then he will see to it that your
bones bleach under the sun.

372
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:27,497
I see.

373
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,671
And I would have provided
him with a choice.

374
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:38,322
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

375
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:42,192
I cannot tell you where
to find the Elder.

376
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:47,018
You fail to understand.

377
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:49,105
The Elder is not
a man you find.

378
00:54:49,148 --> 00:54:51,540
He can only choose
to find <i>you</i>.

379
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,540
You wish to speak with him?

380
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:56,931
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

381
00:54:56,974 --> 00:55:01,844
Canis Minor, the dog that followed
Orion through the sky.

382
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,931
You follow the brightest star.

383
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:06,497
Walk until you are almost dead.

384
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,192
Then, keep walking.

385
00:55:09,235 --> 00:55:11,235
When you are on
your last breath,

386
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:15,235
he will find you...
or he will not.

387
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,671
I am grateful.

388
00:55:21,322 --> 00:55:22,671
Thank you, sir.

389
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:28,061
Perhaps you were not
listening before.

390
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:33,322
The social contract.

391
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:36,192
The commerce of relationships.

392
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,713
You have received
a great gift.

393
00:55:39,757 --> 00:55:41,061
I have hosted your friend.

394
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:44,018
What do you offer in return?

395
00:55:48,366 --> 00:55:50,974
So soft and yet so fierce.

396
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:54,018
I love it, this dog.

397
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:56,844
I will keep it.

398
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,148
Excuse me?

399
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,931
This will be my gift.

400
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:02,540
This will be how you
show me your fealty.

401
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:03,844
No.

402
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:06,148
Surely it's the
least you can do.

403
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:08,148
No, you cannot keep my dog.

404
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:10,670
Very well.

405
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,235
Very well.

406
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,018
Then I will kill it.

407
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:24,105
I'm sorry, Sofia.

408
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,322
This was for you to learn.

409
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:35,974
Don't.

410
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:19,757
Sofia. Don't.

411
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:26,626
He shot my dog.

412
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,453
I get it.

413
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,844
We gotta go. Now.

414
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:10,539
Here you go.

415
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:17,844
You're gonna die, John.

416
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:23,626
Whether out here in this desert,
or somewhere else down the road.

417
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,105
But you <i>are</i> gonna die.

418
01:04:42,452 --> 01:04:44,147
Consequences.

419
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:49,539
Consequences.

420
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:17,974
Better get going.

421
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:28,626
Sofia.

422
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:11,365
Okay.

423
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,321
You made your point.

424
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:21,670
You have earned my fealty.

425
01:08:22,757 --> 01:08:24,060
Matter of fact...

426
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:25,887
I'm gonna shove so much
fealty up your ass

427
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,713
it's gonna come spilling
out of your mouth.

428
01:08:27,757 --> 01:08:29,930
You had your chance.

429
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:35,190
Well, since you see it that way,
I guess it's time I told you

430
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:39,147
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

431
01:08:39,191 --> 01:08:41,147
Duly noted.

432
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:42,887
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

433
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:46,713
your penance will be
paid with seven cuts.

434
01:08:46,757 --> 01:08:49,408
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

435
01:08:53,191 --> 01:08:55,496
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

436
01:08:56,408 --> 01:08:59,321
The king is dead.

437
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,191
Long live the king.

438
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:01,191
Drink.

439
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,886
Don't worry, your weapon is
still there. Please drink.

440
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:21,408
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

441
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:22,757
Not lost.

442
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,452
Looking for you.

443
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:27,930
You think I speak
of your location?

444
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:33,452
Never seen a man fight so hard
to end up back where he started.

445
01:10:41,191 --> 01:10:43,191
So tell me, Jonathan.

446
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:45,191
Why do you wish to live?

447
01:10:45,843 --> 01:10:49,191
My wife, Helen.

448
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:56,583
To remember her.
To remember us.

449
01:10:56,626 --> 01:10:59,408
So you seek to live for
the memory of love?

450
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,321
At least a chance to earn it.

451
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,234
I can give you one last
chance to earn a life.

452
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:11,365
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

453
01:11:13,017 --> 01:11:16,973
Complete a task for us and your
Excommunicado will be reversed.

454
01:11:17,017 --> 01:11:19,234
The open contract closed,

455
01:11:19,278 --> 01:11:21,321
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

456
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:24,452
Not free under the Table
but bound to it.

457
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:27,496
Doing what you do best for
the rest of your days.

458
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:33,321
The choice is yours.

459
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:37,670
Die here and now.

460
01:11:37,713 --> 01:11:40,670
Or continue to live and
remember through death.

461
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,104
What must be done?

462
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:03,234
The cost of your life will
be the death of others.

463
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,886
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

464
01:12:07,017 --> 01:12:08,147
What?

465
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,886
He has forgotten his fealty.

466
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,496
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

467
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:16,104
will be lifted until you
complete your task.

468
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:21,539
So if you wish to live and
if you wish to remember,

469
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,365
this is the choice
you must make.

470
01:12:40,278 --> 01:12:42,278
I will serve.

471
01:12:44,365 --> 01:12:47,408
I will be of service.

472
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,539
Very well, my son.

473
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,539
Cast aside your weakness

474
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,408
and reaffirm your fealty
to the Table.

475
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,886
Mr. John Wick.

476
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:51,191
Thank you.

477
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:56,365
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

478
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,452
I wish you good luck
on your path.

479
01:14:16,496 --> 01:14:19,234
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

480
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,147
And Mr. Wick.

481
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:05,060
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

482
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:08,017
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

483
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:32,408
Stick together, kids.

484
01:16:39,104 --> 01:16:42,495
You see? That's why you're
special, John Wick.

485
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,495
I wouldn't have stopped.

486
01:16:48,843 --> 01:16:50,495
It's good to have you back.

487
01:16:57,365 --> 01:16:59,147
How was your trip?

488
01:17:01,799 --> 01:17:03,799
Going to the Continental?

489
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,669
He with you?

490
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:14,060
He was.

491
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:25,799
Nice trick.

492
01:20:33,191 --> 01:20:35,799
Sir! Put your weapon down.

493
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:40,060
He's Excommunicado.

494
01:20:40,104 --> 01:20:42,451
Unless you wish to
become the same...

495
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:46,799
...I suggest you
lower your gun.

496
01:20:52,799 --> 01:20:54,843
I'd like to see the manager.

497
01:20:57,277 --> 01:20:59,364
Of course.

498
01:20:59,407 --> 01:21:02,017
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

499
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,712
Please take a seat.

500
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:18,973
I will let him know
you have arrived.

501
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,277
I gotta tell you.

502
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,407
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

503
01:21:58,451 --> 01:22:01,495
I'm a huge fan, John Wick.

504
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:06,712
And so far, you haven't
disappointed.

505
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:12,407
Is that <i>the</i> dog?

506
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:14,669
He likes you.

507
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:19,017
Me? I'm more of a
cat person myself.

508
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:21,146
Hey, dog.

509
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:28,320
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

510
01:22:28,364 --> 01:22:30,538
We're not the same.

511
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:31,973
Yes, we are.

512
01:22:32,756 --> 01:22:34,572
No, we're not.

513
01:22:35,582 --> 01:22:37,973
The manager is ready
for you now.

514
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:39,712
In the administrative
lounge, sir.

515
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:55,886
Mr. Wick.

516
01:22:58,059 --> 01:22:59,103
Sit.

517
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:01,799
Stay.

518
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,320
Good dog.

519
01:24:00,364 --> 01:24:02,669
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

520
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:14,712
We only use this room
on special occasions.

521
01:24:14,756 --> 01:24:18,799
When you simply <i>have</i> to see
what your opponent is holding

522
01:24:18,843 --> 01:24:20,407
under the table.

523
01:24:22,364 --> 01:24:24,495
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

524
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:26,843
Yeah.

525
01:24:26,886 --> 01:24:28,460
Well, of course.

526
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:33,451
They sent men to kill <i>you</i>
and now you to kill <i>me</i>.

527
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,582
Isn't that why you're here?

528
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:41,277
I have served, I will
be of service.

529
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:45,278
But you're having doubts.

530
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,016
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

531
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:52,016
If you feel you must...

532
01:24:54,538 --> 01:24:56,712
...put a bullet
through my heart.

533
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:05,799
The High Table has asked
me to step down.

534
01:25:05,843 --> 01:25:07,320
The hour?

535
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,277
The hour.

536
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,495
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

537
01:25:12,712 --> 01:25:15,103
Maybe I should have.

538
01:25:15,146 --> 01:25:17,669
Rules and consequences.

539
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,756
It seems like everyone
is suffering

540
01:25:20,799 --> 01:25:23,233
from the consequences
of their actions.

541
01:25:23,277 --> 01:25:25,538
And you're not stepping down?

542
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:28,972
No.

543
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:31,686
I don't think I am.

544
01:25:31,929 --> 01:25:33,730
So it's war?

545
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:36,146
You're going to war
with the High Table?

546
01:25:36,886 --> 01:25:38,277
Skirmish.

547
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,712
Unless you decide
to shoot me.

548
01:25:39,756 --> 01:25:43,088
But, then, I'd rather die at
the hand of a friend...

549
01:25:43,843 --> 01:25:44,948
...than that of an enemy.

550
01:25:46,495 --> 01:25:49,190
No, I've made my choice. It's
up to you to make yours.

551
01:25:50,843 --> 01:25:53,059
What choice?

552
01:25:53,103 --> 01:25:55,885
You shoot me, you
sell your soul.

553
01:25:55,929 --> 01:26:00,103
But I'll be alive and
I can remember her.

554
01:26:00,146 --> 01:26:02,885
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

555
01:26:02,929 --> 01:26:07,538
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

556
01:26:07,582 --> 01:26:10,929
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

557
01:26:10,972 --> 01:26:14,929
The real question is, who
do you wish to die as?

558
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:17,233
The Baba Yaga?

559
01:26:17,277 --> 01:26:19,407
The last thing many
men ever see?

560
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:24,407
Or as a man who loved and
was loved by his wife?

561
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:27,059
Who do you wish to
die as, Jonathan?

562
01:26:59,277 --> 01:27:02,146
Mr. Wick, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

563
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,799
I am an Adjudicator.

564
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:07,103
Have you decided to step down?

565
01:27:09,712 --> 01:27:11,093
I think not.

566
01:27:12,582 --> 01:27:15,625
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

567
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:22,146
No, I don't think I will.

568
01:27:29,885 --> 01:27:31,190
Very well.

569
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:41,190
Administration.

570
01:27:41,233 --> 01:27:43,233
I'd like to change
a designation.

571
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:45,233
Verification?

572
01:27:45,277 --> 01:27:48,538
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

573
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:50,582
The Continental
Hotel, New York.

574
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:52,538
New designation?

575
01:27:52,582 --> 01:27:53,972
Deconsecrated.

576
01:27:56,755 --> 01:27:57,755
Processing.

577
01:28:00,277 --> 01:28:01,407
Administrator.

578
01:28:02,798 --> 01:28:06,929
File. The New York
Continental Hotel.

579
01:28:17,495 --> 01:28:21,842
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

580
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,669
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

581
01:28:31,712 --> 01:28:34,495
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

582
01:28:34,538 --> 01:28:37,081
Since you are refusing
to step down and you are

583
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:41,146
refusing a direct order,
your lives are now forfeit.

584
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,363
High Table emissaries will
be joining you presently

585
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:45,972
to see the removal of your
souls from the property.

586
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:49,233
Good evening, gentlemen.

587
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,538
This haven is safe no more.

588
01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:02,146
Are services still
off limits to me?

589
01:29:02,929 --> 01:29:04,277
Under the circumstances,

590
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,364
your privileges are
reinstated immediately.

591
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:07,755
What do you need?

592
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:11,515
Guns. Lots of guns.

593
01:29:29,842 --> 01:29:31,842
Let's make a withdrawal.

594
01:29:55,972 --> 01:29:57,451
Remember, sir.

595
01:29:57,495 --> 01:29:59,842
These will be High Table forces.

596
01:29:59,885 --> 01:30:02,364
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

597
01:30:02,972 --> 01:30:04,233
Why?

598
01:30:04,277 --> 01:30:05,929
Much has changed during
your time away.

599
01:30:06,711 --> 01:30:08,103
Like what?

600
01:30:08,146 --> 01:30:10,755
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

601
01:30:18,755 --> 01:30:22,668
May I suggest the
2011 Combat Master

602
01:30:22,711 --> 01:30:25,016
in combination with the
nine millimeter major.

603
01:30:36,582 --> 01:30:38,320
Attention, all guests.

604
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:41,755
The Continental Hotel is
closing for fumigation.

605
01:30:41,798 --> 01:30:43,538
We apologize for
the inconvenience.

606
01:30:43,582 --> 01:30:45,538
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

607
01:30:53,103 --> 01:30:56,668
It seems circumstances have
changed in your favor.

608
01:30:56,711 --> 01:30:59,789
Your transaction may now be
conducted on Continental grounds.

609
01:31:05,842 --> 01:31:09,059
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

610
01:31:09,103 --> 01:31:12,059
Cool. Very cool.

611
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:21,711
125 grain, 1,425
feet per second.

612
01:31:21,755 --> 01:31:23,624
Serious business.

613
01:31:26,885 --> 01:31:28,320
Thank you.

614
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:29,929
Let us begin.

615
01:33:16,233 --> 01:33:19,059
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

616
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:21,537
Of course, sir.

617
01:33:42,711 --> 01:33:45,537
I know you'll do the
Continental proud.

618
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:47,146
I'll see you soon, sir.

619
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:53,711
And you Jonathan, do
what you do best.

620
01:33:53,755 --> 01:33:54,972
What's that?

621
01:33:55,624 --> 01:33:57,146
Hunt.

622
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:33,711
Winston! Winston!

623
01:37:37,798 --> 01:37:40,319
I need more firepower.

624
01:38:03,016 --> 01:38:04,929
Armor improvements.

625
01:38:04,972 --> 01:38:08,016
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

626
01:41:35,276 --> 01:41:37,363
Only by my sword, John.

627
01:41:49,494 --> 01:41:51,755
I know you believe you
can keep this up.

628
01:41:51,798 --> 01:41:53,015
But I assure you...

629
01:49:57,754 --> 01:50:00,449
John, you're incredible.

630
01:50:01,363 --> 01:50:02,449
Exhausted...

631
01:50:02,928 --> 01:50:04,797
outnumbered...

632
01:50:04,841 --> 01:50:06,232
...obviously in pain.

633
01:50:07,493 --> 01:50:10,015
And you still beat
all of my students.

634
01:50:10,058 --> 01:50:11,928
If I didn't have
to kill you...

635
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,971
...we'd be pals.

636
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,102
Let's do this.

637
01:50:44,797 --> 01:50:47,449
See? We're the same.

638
01:54:33,884 --> 01:54:36,536
I would like to
suggest a parley.

639
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:38,231
A parley would be good.

640
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:39,580
Very well.

641
01:54:50,754 --> 01:54:52,449
Are we in play, sir?

642
01:54:54,102 --> 01:54:55,449
Oh, very much so.

643
01:55:14,928 --> 01:55:16,536
Hey, John.

644
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:21,275
That was a pretty
good fight, huh?

645
01:55:25,101 --> 01:55:26,362
Yeah.

646
01:55:55,841 --> 01:55:57,754
Yeah.

647
01:55:57,797 --> 01:56:01,362
Don't worry about me, John.

648
01:56:01,405 --> 01:56:03,493
I just gotta catch my breath.

649
01:56:05,405 --> 01:56:07,058
I'll catch up to you, John.

650
01:56:12,318 --> 01:56:14,231
No, you won't.

651
01:56:24,797 --> 01:56:28,188
You gentlemen, of course realize
that was the <i>first</i> wave.

652
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:30,710
Merely an amuse-bouche.

653
01:56:30,754 --> 01:56:32,405
We can keep this up as
long as you'd like,

654
01:56:32,449 --> 01:56:34,144
but it only ends one way.

655
01:56:34,188 --> 01:56:36,710
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

656
01:56:36,754 --> 01:56:39,057
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

657
01:56:39,101 --> 01:56:41,710
Oh, you can take the Continental,
I have no doubt about that.

658
01:56:41,754 --> 01:56:43,971
But keeping it, that's a
different matter entirely.

659
01:56:44,015 --> 01:56:47,188
My allegiances run way
beyond this building.

660
01:56:48,057 --> 01:56:49,667
We are High Table.

661
01:56:50,318 --> 01:56:51,580
And we...

662
01:56:52,754 --> 01:56:54,493
...are New York City.

663
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:57,188
Are we negotiating?

664
01:57:00,928 --> 01:57:02,362
I believe we are.

665
01:57:08,057 --> 01:57:09,057
Parley?

666
01:57:09,971 --> 01:57:11,318
Parley.

667
01:57:14,841 --> 01:57:16,971
What do you propose we do?

668
01:57:21,144 --> 01:57:23,057
Let me keep my power.

669
01:57:23,623 --> 01:57:24,754
Under the Table.

670
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:32,275
I have served and been a
beacon of order and stability

671
01:57:32,318 --> 01:57:34,449
to our industry for
over forty years.

672
01:57:34,493 --> 01:57:37,127
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped and

673
01:57:37,128 --> 01:57:39,841
re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

674
01:57:42,275 --> 01:57:43,754
Winston.

675
01:57:49,405 --> 01:57:51,014
You were merely
showing strength

676
01:57:51,057 --> 01:57:53,536
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

677
01:57:57,188 --> 01:58:00,101
The High Table accepts
your fealty.

678
01:58:01,449 --> 01:58:02,754
But what about him?

679
01:58:04,928 --> 01:58:08,493
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

680
01:58:13,928 --> 01:58:15,623
He has to die.

681
01:58:17,188 --> 01:58:19,057
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

682
01:58:19,101 --> 01:58:20,405
Don't see any other way.

683
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:34,014
Very well, gentlemen.

684
01:58:34,057 --> 01:58:37,318
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

685
01:58:38,275 --> 01:58:40,101
Good day to you both.

686
01:58:44,144 --> 01:58:45,754
Well played, sir.

687
01:59:21,101 --> 01:59:24,057
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

688
01:59:24,101 --> 01:59:25,797
Should be no time at all.

689
01:59:29,797 --> 01:59:31,623
Mr. Wick is gone.

690
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:33,015
A true tragedy.

691
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,658
You misunderstand.

692
01:59:35,014 --> 01:59:36,988
I mean that he is no
longer on the street.

693
01:59:38,014 --> 01:59:39,084
That seems improbable.

694
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:40,479
And yet, true.

695
01:59:42,536 --> 01:59:44,883
I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.

696
01:59:44,927 --> 01:59:46,545
Both from above and below.

697
01:59:47,275 --> 01:59:48,883
The last thing either
one of us needs

698
01:59:48,927 --> 01:59:51,231
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

699
01:59:54,101 --> 01:59:56,101
For both our sakes, I'll
hope you see to it

700
01:59:56,144 --> 01:59:58,449
that this situation is
taken care of, yes?

701
01:59:58,493 --> 02:00:02,101
Absolutely. How far can he get?

702
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,275
Baba Yaga.

703
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,052
How you doing, John?

704
02:00:49,014 --> 02:00:51,263
You look as bad as I feel.

705
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,362
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

706
02:00:56,405 --> 02:00:58,225
Raise a hand if you
can hear me, John.

707
02:01:01,493 --> 02:01:03,961
Oh, shit. They took a finger.

708
02:01:04,405 --> 02:01:05,623
Ain't that a bitch?

709
02:01:12,449 --> 02:01:15,470
John fucking Wick.

710
02:01:16,449 --> 02:01:20,536
So, the old boy keeps his hotel
and you take the fall.

711
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:21,369
Can't say I blame him.

712
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:24,101
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

713
02:01:25,014 --> 02:01:27,330
But this High Table shit.

714
02:01:30,710 --> 02:01:32,181
Seven cuts.

715
02:01:36,014 --> 02:01:38,266
Under the Table is where
shit gets done.

02:01:54,493 --> 02:01:56,188
Let me ask you, John.

How do you feel?

You pissed, John?

723
02:02:08,796 --> 02:02:09,454
Are you?
