00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:30,802
~ Enjoy ~

4
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:56,578
I'm glad I got away from all this.

5
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,572
I pitty you.

6
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,028
Don't bother.

7
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:09,440
- Okay.

8
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,613
You want my rep, right?

9
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,127
Then shoot me.

10
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,534
But know this.

11
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,871
You kill me here without
facing me on the street...

12
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,972
you'll be known for what you are...

13
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,606
Scum.

14
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,411
- And you'll be dead.

15
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,595
And me?

16
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:00,422
I then killed a legend.

17
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,098
Fucking..

18
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:12,497
A last request, grandad?

19
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:31,426
- 1 MONTH EARLIER -

20
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:28,859
What?

21
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,008
- Ahh
Fuck off, huh?

22
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,149
You fucking bitch.

23
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,458
- Ah!

24
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,739
- Uhn..
Ah.

25
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,410
Where do you live, darling?

26
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,381
Ah! Ah!

27
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:47,531
Tell me, where the fuck
do you live, darling?

28
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,124
She lives over there, c'mon just
fucking leave...

29
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,019
Was he talking to you?

30
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,136
- Alright.

31
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:56,134
I want your mom to see this.

32
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,961
If she aint gonna teach you any
fucking rules, then I am.

33
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,350
- Aah!

34
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,183
Is there anyone else who
wants to be a grass (snitch)?

35
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,596
This is what happends
when you talk.

36
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,550
- Uh ohhh..

37
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:45,864
Pay attention.

38
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,654
- Aaahhh!!
Aahhh!

39
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,974
- Aaaah!

40
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,438
I don't want to be doing
shit like this.

41
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,860
Cutting up bitches, and shit.

42
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:24,742
But this is my square.
My fucking square!

43
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:32,705
You people better start playing
by my fucking rules, alright?

44
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:50,854
- I fucking hate you.

45
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,151
I fucking hate you, c'mon.

46
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,701
C'mon!

47
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,529
Get off me.

48
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:21,711
- You go to the nurse, come.
Get. Off. Me.

49
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,180
- You're coming with me.
Get off me, now.

50
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,031
Get off of me, miss.

51
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:28,290
- You mind your mouth, young man.
Oh yeah? yeah?

52
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,837
You're gonna regret this,
I swear.

53
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,009
- I don't want to suspend him.

54
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,300
You should,
if it helps.

55
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,138
He needs to learn.

56
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:47,304
Thank you.

57
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,840
But this is not the kind of conduct
we condone here at Arkequin Park

58
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,838
We don't expect the students to
exhibit such wild behavior.

59
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,399
Thing need to change.

60
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,790
I'm sure it's just boisterous energie.

61
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,754
He's never violent at home.

62
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:06,369
He's a good natured boy.

63
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,824
But this is not the first
fight he's been in.

64
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,544
Sorry, what is it you are
trying to say about my son?

65
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,299
I'll deal with it.

66
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,668
We all do stupid things when
we are young, I mean...

67
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,922
I know that's not an
excuse, ofcourse, but...

68
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,564
Trust me,
I'll deal with this.

69
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,434
This is a waste of time, the girl
aint gonna speak to us.

70
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:28,505
We should just pay the scumbags a visit.

71
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,124
That's not how it works.

72
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,942
Well, we should do,
we know what they did.

73
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,766
And our job is to proof it,
or deal with it.

74
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,511
I didn't shank her and his bitch mate
might deserve a beating.

75
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:43,635
Trust me, Malor, you don't win that way.
- Trust me?

76
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:45,785
We won't end to fill the
third line of the law.

77
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,044
We should be the one
to administer it.

78
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,024
Good afternoon.

79
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,446
We'd like to talk to you about the
situation that happend with your daughter.

80
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,610
Now, no, no, I've you just listen
because we're trying to help. If you..

81
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,266
That went well.

82
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,169
We should do it my way.

83
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,709
Do me. Do me.

84
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:28,014
Ooh.

85
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,336
Pull my finger, bro.

86
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:39,689
She aint gonna fight you.
- You don't know, bro.

87
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,119
Ladies like touching up young boys.

88
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,526
Listen, you little prick.

89
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,832
We know what you did.

90
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:53,690
Ah, you're old, man.

91
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:55,880
What, did you get bullied at school?

92
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,175
Was it a classic one?

93
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,556
Or did your powers just fuck off,
when you took your badge?

94
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,657
It's usually one of the two.

95
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,994
Yeah, do you wanna hit me?
Hit me, bro.

96
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,495
I'm here, just hit me.
Come on.

97
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,879
Give me a little whack.

98
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:10,965
Just a little dig, go on.
Nah, nah, nah don't actually. Yeah, go on.

99
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,947
Give me a little slap, good.
Now, give me a fucking slap.

100
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,116
Yeah.
- Turn around.

101
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,196
Is that all we're doing
down here, guys?

102
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,590
Yeah?
Slashing girls in their face?

103
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:26,633
Fat boy. Skinny boy.
Fuck off.

104
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,785
Move.

105
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:45,886
So is this how you get a name?

106
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:50,839
Coward.

107
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,498
That's what you are.

108
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,181
Common criminal.

109
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,376
You lack the courage to be anything...

110
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,866
Memorable.

111
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:12,529
Are we done yet?

112
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:18,006
Here's a guy that's gonna
get away with this shit.

113
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:21,064
When the guvnors was around...

114
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,322
They would have done you fucking here.

115
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,351
Now they were memorable.

116
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,266
They had everybody's respect.

117
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,410
Something you'll never have.

118
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,411
Yeah boys, you're free to go.

119
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,026
Hello?
- Hey Ange, it's Michelle, can we talk?

120
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,972
Yeah, sorry,
Now is not a good time actually.

121
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:42,134
Yeah yeah,
tomorrow is better.

122
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,026
Sorry.
Alright, thanks.

123
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,143
Come on babe, you're just standing here

124
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:56,880
Who was that?

125
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:58,888
Ugh, it's just some salesman.

126
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,816
They drive me mad.

127
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,585
Do you want a cup?
- Yeah, sure.

128
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,817
Don't you ever, fucking call
this number again.

129
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,013
Do you understand?

130
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,600
Hey Mitch,
you want to see this, mate

131
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,697
Look at this guy.
- Oh, fucking hell.

132
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,224
Straight in.

133
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,949
You'd be outside by now.
You'd be legging it like a geezer.

134
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,673
I would have pissed myself.

135
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,273
I mean, literaly pissed myself.
Actually there on the spot.

136
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,104
He's swinging a fucking chairs.

137
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,793
Man, you've gotta stand strong
when it comes to these things.

138
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:24,114
What, so you throw something small...

139
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,099
and suddenly he just drops
his chainsaw and surrenders?

140
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,724
Stop talking shit, Paul.

141
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:28,944
What you reckon in this one?

142
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,843
Would you stand and fight,
or would you leg it?

143
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:32,721
Shouldn't have got to that.

144
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,421
Should've been stopped
before he got inside.

145
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:36,080
Yeah, but it's only a small
local pub, aint it?

146
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,373
There aint no security.
Who's gonna stop it?

147
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,538
It's not like he's carrying a knife.

148
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,100
He's had to be walking down the
street with that thing in his hand.

149
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,626
Just traveling down the
road with a chainsaw.

150
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:47,047
Gotta go to round my nange
and fix shit.

151
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,509
Her chainsaw ran out of battery.

152
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:53,444
Once you're inside you
gotta work as a unit.

153
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,867
Look at his body position.

154
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,289
He's not in control
of that weapon.

155
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:01,578
As long as one of
you faces him...

156
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,266
Close enough to get his
attention, but far enough

157
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,530
away to avoid a launch,
then you're in business.

158
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,219
And the other two...

159
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:11,146
One comes from here.

160
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,862
And one from here.

161
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,749
One attacks from behind.

162
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,117
One goes low.
Simple.

163
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,769
Yeah, saw it in a film somewhere.

164
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,309
Listen, get back to work you boys.

165
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,635
This isn't an olderly camp.

166
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,315
We've got clients to please.

167
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,110
He thinks he's Rambo.

168
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,344
Yeah, give him a beer.
He doesn't have beer over here.

169
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,093
Nah, you know I don't drink beer mate.
I've got subscripts.

170
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:31,515
It's not about meds,
it's about your misses.

171
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,144
Fuck off.

172
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,808
I'm the guvnor.

173
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,895
What?
The guvnor?

174
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:41,753
Yeah.

175
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:44,015
You weren't the fucking
guvnor at City last week.

176
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,694
Hey, take your mind back
to West Ham away.

177
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:48,391
I saved your fucking life,
as usual.

178
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,955
Ah, fuck you saved my life.

179
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,089
Oi, the guvnor is the boss.

180
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:54,174
Look at the size of you.

181
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,286
I'll have you.

182
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,452
Is that right?
- Yeah, come here.

183
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,821
- Bing, bing, bing.

184
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,564
You wanna touch me,
or what?

185
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,261
You do that again...

186
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,446
And I'll fill you.

187
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,030
Careful mate, he's our case.

188
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:19,263
I think the guvnor just
shit himself

189
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,676
- Bye darling.

190
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,312
- Love you.

191
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:53,970
Have you been talking about me?

192
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,119
- No.

193
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,154
I don't mind,
I quite like it.

194
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:04,224
Do you reckon I'm a better
than the guvnors?

195
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,831
Uh, I don't care.

196
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,764
Yeah, now, neither do I,
but I heard rumours...

197
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,163
That some oldschool bollocks
now don't like it.

198
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:12,392
Five, fifty-five, please

199
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,376
Not today.

200
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,896
Now don't believe all the
hairy chest stuff.

201
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,864
It's simple, greens are good
for your football.

202
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,234
Eat these...

203
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,860
And it will make you a better player.

204
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,829
- But I hate 'em.
Just eat it.

205
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,492
- But you don't eat them.
And?

206
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:34,911
Good boy.

207
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,623
Alright, I gotta pop out
for an hour, or so.

208
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,846
But if these aren't gone by
the time I get back.

209
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,088
No boots.

210
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,747
Oi.
Don't give me that.

211
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,513
You good?

212
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,119
See you in a bit, yeah?

213
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,211
Why are you sweeping?

214
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,649
What did you do at school today?

215
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:04,883
Not much.

216
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,596
You much have done something.

217
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,368
No mom. Same as yesterday
and the day before.

218
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,564
- Show your mother...

219
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,111
Some fucking respect.

220
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:24,096
Say sorry.

221
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,684
Sorry.

222
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,931
Mitch, calm down, he's just
being fair to humor.

223
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,341
Jump up and down.

224
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,761
Go on.
Jump up and down.

225
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:38,714
- Mitch..

226
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:39,903
Do it!

227
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,121
Stop it.
What the hell is going on?

228
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,469
Do you want to tell her?
Or should I?

229
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,334
Mitch, what's going on?

230
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,080
Come here.

231
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,366
Come here!

232
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,074
Do you want me to spit
in your face aswell, boy?

233
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,060
What the hell is going on?

234
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:58,945
Dont you ever let me catch you
doing anything like that ever again.

235
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,073
Now go to your room!

236
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:02,218
Go on!

237
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:07,869
Mitch..

238
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,820
Where are the guvnors?

239
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,458
May I help you, lads?

240
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:08,310
Yeah, maybe.

241
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,920
We're looking for a bunch
of old fuckers..

242
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:14,413
Who like to call
themself the guvnors.

243
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,490
Have you seen them?

244
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,000
No guvnors in here, son.

245
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:24,029
Only me.

246
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,159
Is that right?

247
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,578
Who are you?

248
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,662
I think you know who I am.

249
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:35,971
No.
I give up.

250
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,591
Who are you?

251
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,153
I wrecked a man named Strongman,
didn't I?

252
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:41,843
Not really.

253
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,040
Have you got any ID?

254
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,220
Are you boys all over 18?
Now aren't ya?

255
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,344
Fuck off.

256
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:49,135
Alright.

257
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,025
Outside.

258
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:54,146
Fancy it?

259
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:58,600
No, I'm alright.

260
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:02,546
Nah, it's just I don't tend
to brawl with the footsoldiers

261
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,344
I want to have a crack at your boss.

262
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:09,893
Mitch, right?

263
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,081
He left 20 years ago.

264
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:15,076
He's miles out, and I don't know where.
So...

265
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:16,913
Good luck with that.

266
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:20,349
It's pretty much impossible to
lose people these days.

267
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,833
Haven't you heard of the internet?

268
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:29,153
Fucking hell, ofcourse you haven't.
It's like a time warp in here.

269
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,699
This used to be the most
feared pub in London, and now...

270
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,919
It looks like a badly
decorated job center.

271
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,412
Do yourself a favor.

272
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,389
Get out.

273
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:45,049
I think I might buy a pint.

274
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:46,979
Back off, son.

275
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,148
The guvnors are extinct.

276
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,605
But for the record...

277
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:55,003
If I was still a player.

278
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:59,207
You're exactly the kind of dealing shit,
I'd string up for fun.

279
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:00,825
Yeah, is that right?

280
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,234
Yeah.

281
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:06,885
Well, you know what, grandad?

282
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:11,371
I'm a little fucked off with the
tone everyone is taking with me in here.

283
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,596
I came down...

284
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:18,399
To ask some simple questions.

285
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,417
In truth, I came here in peace.

286
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,453
To show my respect.

287
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,445
Leave and it can stay that way.

288
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:32,525
But if you don't...

289
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:36,953
I'll be forced to give you a little
hide of myself.

290
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:40,616
You're joking.

291
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,834
Fucking hell, who's this?
The walking dead?

292
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,866
Your time is long gone,
old man.

293
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:51,769
Sit down...

294
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,137
And shut up.

295
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,503
Ow!

296
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,908
Ta-da.

297
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:10,982
One punch.

298
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:23,623
You made my fucking day, Mick.

299
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,983
What do you want?

300
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,136
- A cup of tea.

301
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,632
Good man.

302
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,241
Oi boss, come and have
a look at this.

303
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:42,681
Mitch, this old timer knocks
out this little lyric...

304
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,199
It is exceptional.

305
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:45,777
If you're alright,
I'm busy.

306
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,421
Oh c'mon boss,
have a bust at this.

307
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,455
Email it to me,
I'll watch it later.

308
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:52,891
Ba-Boom!

309
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:54,723
Lads!

310
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:56,723
Thank you.

311
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,501
G'Morning.

312
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:03,888
G'Afternoon.

313
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,470
The old Mick,
you've only gone viral.

314
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:09,986
Viral?

315
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,081
Don't worry, there's
no catching.

316
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,669
Half a million people have seen you
online, smacking that twat.

317
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:16,864
What?

318
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:18,915
Last night...

319
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,609
CCTV.

320
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:23,475
Good.

321
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,886
Coming in this pub like that.

322
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,682
They got no idea.

323
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,676
I mean; There's no hierarchy, is there?

324
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,450
I don't want to rain them in,
not like you.

325
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,503
They should put back conscription.

326
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:36,612
Wouldn't have done us any good.

327
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:38,293
I mean, we weren't much
better, were we?

328
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,676
Ah well, you weren't criminals...

329
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,167
I just told you how to
defend yourselfs, that's all.

330
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,393
Things got a bit out of hand.

331
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,649
By coming in here...

332
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:52,386
You'd make a commitment.

333
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,230
A commitment to the people
who sat next to you.

334
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:59,018
A commitment to me.

335
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:02,090
You can come in here night and day.

336
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:04,832
It could be somewhere you
can call home.

337
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:09,032
A place,
where you learn life.

338
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,554
But I've got 2 rules.

339
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:13,734
Number 1:

340
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,569
Any trouble outside...

341
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,019
You'll leave at the door.

342
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:19,797
You come here to train.

343
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:22,076
Any drama's...

344
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,280
And you're out.

345
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,617
Number 2:

346
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:28,496
The people sat next to you...

347
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:30,949
Are now your family.

348
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,114
Your people.

349
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:34,865
Your blood.

350
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:37,286
Family...

351
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,732
Is the most important thing.

352
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:42,632
Welcome.

353
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,278
I don't know why you
picked these ones up.

354
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,235
I've only given you 50 quid.

355
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,759
- But Ronaldo has got these.

356
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,432
Yeah, but when he started out,
he would have killed for these.

357
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:12,608
I'll do you a deal, yeah?

358
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,866
You score 30 goals in these this season..

359
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,794
And I'll buy these ones
next year, alright?

360
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:18,610
- What if I score 40?

361
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,504
Okay look, try them on.

362
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:27,904
Look, they're just like
mile-boots...

363
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:29,336
Beautiful.

364
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,427
Clean.

365
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:31,439
Classic.

366
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:33,266
- Shit.
Oi!

367
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:36,515
Anymore of that and
you get no boots, alright?

368
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:40,361
Now, wrap them up.

369
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:42,941
Take them to the till.
And lets pay for them, alright?

370
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:45,826
Hey, bro!

371
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,383
Can you get down over here,
real quick?

372
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,655
Yeah, I just have a little question
about one of them T-shirts down here.

373
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,695
- Which one then?
Euh.. It's just..

374
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,578
If I ever see you outside
this shop again...

375
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,995
I swear to fuck,
I'll cut your throat, alright?

376
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:04,108
- Yeah.

377
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:06,952
Is there anything more
to be laughing about?

378
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:08,138
- No, mate.

379
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:10,815
Good.

380
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,456
You know, I'm not
ashamed of who I am.

381
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,993
I'm not ashamed of who I was.

382
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:43,282
But I don't want you
to become me.

383
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,408
You are much
better than that.

384
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:57,113
I thought you weren't
gonna take me to football?

385
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,023
International is a different.

386
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,085
And we're in a box.

387
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:11,568
Your great-grand father...

388
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,280
Used to take us to
game on a bus.

389
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,228
He used to carry this
silly little duffle bag...

390
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,839
With a pair of boots in it,
in case the team where a man down.

391
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,514
- Yeah, but what about his shin guards?

392
00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:23,383
Who cares about shin guards,
you can kick a ball and save his life.

393
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,996
And who is gonna pick him out of a crowd?
He wasn't Stanley Petrol.

394
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:26,711
- Who?

395
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,969
Never mind.

396
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,787
- What about you?

397
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:30,747
- Where you any good?

398
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,794
They used to call me
"The Made Net Maradona".

399
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:33,561
- Who?

400
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,976
Diego Maradona.

401
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,885
- No clue.

402
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:38,595
You are joking.

403
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:39,462
- No.

404
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,425
Nothing matches this.

405
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,365
You can try and find
the excitement elsewhere...

406
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,921
But it just don't exists.

407
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,440
The nerves.
The tension.

408
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:55,700
For the next 90 minutes,
anything can happen.

409
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,997
I'm sorry it took me so
long to bring you here, my son.

410
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:03,643
Look at that.

411
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,962
Oi, you there.

412
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,998
I think you're in the wrong
fucking box, mate.

413
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,608
Go inside.

414
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:28,898
- Dad, it's fine.

415
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,678
Inside.
Now.

416
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:42,292
Look, I'm not after any
trouble, alright?

417
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:44,582
I think you're past that.

418
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,004
What's going on here then?

419
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:48,124
Top boys reunion.

420
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,664
Where would we be if we
didn't have you, champ?

421
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,814
You would have a family, Steve.

422
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:55,533
Well, there is only so much
of that shit I can handle.

423
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:00,808
Well...

424
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,599
I'm gonna go and sit with my boy.

425
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,251
I would introduce you,
but, euhh...

426
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:10,576
What you gonna say?

427
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,100
This is Bads, we used to kick
the fuck out of eachother.

428
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:16,153
Exactly.

429
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:33,744
Look after yourselfs.

430
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:40,129
I'm gonna beat the fuck
out of that old guy.

431
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,289
I don't give a shit.

432
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,864
Chill,
this guys is...

433
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,807
No one fucking disrespects
me like that!

434
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,567
- Bom.
What?

435
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,197
- Boom.
What?!

436
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,241
What is it?

437
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:16,621
How the fuck...?

438
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:18,728
I know you wanna
show of the old fellow.

439
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,327
But we got chance with
the other Guvnors here.

440
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:23,840
I'll send a little message
of to him first.

441
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,991
I'll go.

442
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,279
Alright.

443
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:32,967
Tomorrow.

444
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,481
Let me get the old man.

445
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:55,718
Stay there.

446
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:57,723
Move!

447
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,320
Can I have a word please, mate?

448
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,684
I heard that you were though.

449
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,475
I want to have a little chat.

450
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:14,031
I'm an old friend
of your dad.

451
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:16,884
I want you to tell him...

452
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,933
I'm going after the old man...

453
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,757
And then tell him I'm
coming after him.

454
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,503
Tell him I know where you live.

455
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,151
Now open your fucking mouth.

456
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,356
- No.

457
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,077
No.

458
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,052
Show him that.

459
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,059
Hey, here he is.

460
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,078
Come here.

461
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,100
I wanted to do
that for years.

462
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:03,009
I never knew you
felt that way.

463
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,653
Not the kisses,
the punch.

464
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,261
That little shit
had it coming.

465
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:07,371
Right, I know.

466
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,738
What are you having?

467
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,659
Alright, chips for me...

468
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:12,245
Better sausage for Nil.

469
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,318
No, just give us a normal sausage...

470
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,296
You just make it a better one for me.

471
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,445
You got that, sis?
- Got it.

472
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,009
Apparantly...

473
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:35,006
We can have those tickets for
every England friendly.

474
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,525
Are you alright?

475
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,371
The kid that did this
wanted you.

476
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:04,446
The kid came to my
school and said...

477
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,395
I should tell you that he'd
batter the old man.

478
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:11,427
And you're next.

479
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:25,776
 I'll ask around and find out
what this is about okay? Just eh...

480
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,520
Please don't tell your mother.

481
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:02,014
Mickey!

482
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,512
Mick!

483
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,085
C'mon you lazy old sob.

484
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:12,733
Breakfast won't make itself.

485
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:24,108
Oh no, Mickey.
Mickey!

486
00:41:00,384 --> 00:41:01,735
You fucking!

487
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:05,738
It's alright...

488
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:06,691
It's alright.

489
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:31,100
Hello?

490
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:33,640
No, not at the moment.

491
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:36,271
No, I'll speak to
you later.

492
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:37,287
Okay.

493
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:42,654
Is someone harassing you?

494
00:41:42,704 --> 00:41:43,595
No, no.

495
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:44,463
It's fine.

496
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:47,345
Come on.

497
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,845
- But mom...
Out.

498
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,780
I love you.

499
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:41,356
What did I tell you
about calling this...

500
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:42,572
Yeah...

501
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:15,304
We're all here today
to remember Mickey...

502
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,480
One of the best.

503
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,717
Mick told me to mean it
if he's named Mush.

504
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,555
He said: Mush people...

505
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:29,383
I thought it was from blacksmith.

506
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,804
You know...

507
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:34,168
A man who works with iron and steel.

508
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:36,673
And not a bad description
of his left and right, eh?

509
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:42,066
But it's a.. It's an older word.

510
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:45,298
German word.

511
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:49,240
Schmitten

512
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:52,370
It means...

513
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:53,449
Soldier.

514
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:00,044
That was the Mickey I knew.

515
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:04,230
Mick was always there for me.

516
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:06,734
For all of us.

517
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:10,551
He gave us a place to call home.

518
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,775
He thaught me
everthing I know.

519
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:20,255
And now he's gone.

520
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,100
Loved his quote's, Mick.

521
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:33,385
So...

522
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:35,566
Here...

523
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,298
Here's one for the ferryman.

524
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,517
It's Mark Twain.
Yeah?

525
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:45,059
The fear of death...

526
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,254
Follows from the fear of life.

527
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,705
The man who has lived fully...

528
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,567
Is prepared to die at any time.

529
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,704
To Mickey.
- To Mickey!

530
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:02,493
Cheers.

531
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:03,872
Michelle...

532
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:05,155
Are you eh?...

533
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:07,896
Just keep an eye on
eh.. you, alright? Okay.

534
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:29,558
How did you let this happen?

535
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:33,935
Excuse me?

536
00:45:35,188 --> 00:45:36,259
Who's the kid?

537
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:38,830
No, not today.

538
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:40,706
Not now.

539
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:43,238
Who is he?

540
00:45:44,556 --> 00:45:46,657
20 years...
No explanation...

541
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:48,956
No apology...

542
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:49,920
No nothing.

543
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:52,874
I ain't come here for
your foregiveness.

544
00:45:56,348 --> 00:45:59,129
I couldn't give a shit what you
or anyone else thinks of me.

545
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:00,339
I know that.

546
00:46:00,512 --> 00:46:03,214
Don't know that you
want the same thing as me.

547
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,364
So don't fight me on this.

548
00:46:10,336 --> 00:46:11,898
Do this with me.

549
00:46:14,261 --> 00:46:15,230
Well?

550
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:18,687
Adam Shanko.

551
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,851
He's the wanker Mickey
slapped on the video.

552
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,424
What's his story?

553
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:35,717
He's a prick.

554
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,593
Why did Mickey get involved?

555
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,577
The kid came in the pub...

556
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:46,963
Looking for you.

557
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:51,936
That's another body
on your list.

558
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:56,339
You do remember Charlie?

559
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,509
Where are the others?
Why aren't they here?

560
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,547
Because I told them
not to come.

561
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:17,130
Mickey wouldn't have...

562
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:19,257
He wouldn't want it to fuzz.

563
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:22,608
Well, we're gonna need them.

564
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:24,151
For what?

565
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,956
Pull yourself together.

566
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:36,596
And take me to the boys.

567
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:39,365
Alright.

568
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,552
For Mickey.

569
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,995
But they aint gonna like you.

570
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,150
No one around here
respects you anymore.

571
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:54,455
Not since you walked.

572
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,339
Stay here,
I'll be back.

573
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:50,076
Fat boy!

574
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:52,765
Hello son.

575
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,360
How you doing?

576
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:57,181
Nice to see you.

577
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:00,808
How you feeling?
Feeling alright?

578
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:11,202
Just tell us Adam Shanko
put you up to this.

579
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,731
Cause we know.

580
00:50:13,517 --> 00:50:15,470
And this would be all over.

581
00:50:16,577 --> 00:50:17,632
When you get older.

582
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:20,133
People are always gonna describe
things to you by saying...

583
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:22,195
It's just like riding a bike.

584
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,642
So you got to learn.

585
00:50:33,245 --> 00:50:34,691
They got Jade.

586
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,333
Yeah, don't worry.

587
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,054
He's good.
He won't talk.

588
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:41,730
Well, he better fucking not.

589
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,214
I got this,
I got this.

590
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:47,094
Jade...

591
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,095
This isn't a joke.

592
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:51,209
This is fucking real life.

593
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:55,972
Jade...

594
00:50:58,182 --> 00:50:59,330
Jade...

595
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,802
It's a girls name.

596
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,518
You'll be the biggest sissy
bitch on the wing.

597
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,300
What was your mother thinking?

598
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:11,172
Oi!

599
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,612
You promised you'd look after him.
- Yeah I will.

600
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,150
Well it doesn't look like it to me.

601
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,412
- It will only be a couple of..

602
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:18,289
Na na na.

603
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:21,126
My boy doing time is
not an option, yeah?

604
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:23,063
You don't tell a mother you're
going to look after her child...

605
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:25,027
And then speak:
It's only gonna be a bit of bird.

606
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:26,315
Yeah, but there's
nothing I can do.

607
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:27,688
Yes, there is.

608
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,699
No, there's not!

609
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:31,639
I've kept his nose clean for years now.

610
00:51:31,698 --> 00:51:33,784
He'll be out in no time.

611
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,417
Oh, so while he's rotting in there,
you're on road yeah?

612
00:51:36,453 --> 00:51:37,320
Listen...

613
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:39,851
I know where ever he was
that night, you where too.

614
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,086
Listen...

615
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,902
Don't make me call this geezer, yeah?

616
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:47,292
I'm telling you now,
don't make me call him.

617
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:49,556
Yeah, I'm being serious.

618
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,659
You'd better sort this out,
I want my child back.

619
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:08,189
I don't know why I have to go.

620
00:52:08,223 --> 00:52:10,051
But they say they want me there.

621
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:16,305
I went to the wake.

622
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:18,685
I've made my peace,
that's it.

623
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,305
Listen, we need to talk.

624
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,048
Could you come around
my way and meet me?

625
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,861
I'm going away on business.
With Mike.

626
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,745
Yeah, I'm a bit worried
about something.

627
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:34,356
Why would I risk all this?

628
00:52:35,881 --> 00:52:37,287
I'll see you then.

629
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:43,364
I just think he might
be planning something.

630
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:45,319
Yeah, well...

631
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:48,347
He won't be showing his face
around of red guards, would he?

632
00:52:48,473 --> 00:52:50,208
Don't be so sure.

633
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,592
I'll run some checks.

634
00:52:53,981 --> 00:52:55,731
I can't lose him now.

635
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,503
Not after everything
we've been through.

636
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:03,927
You've come a long way.

637
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:05,116
Yeah.

638
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:07,720
And I'm not going back.

639
00:53:10,013 --> 00:53:11,332
You can't do that.

640
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:13,012
Ofcourse I can.

641
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,682
Check out the Plaza
down on Oxford Street.

642
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:17,030
Walk through to the main bit...

643
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:18,769
And look directly up.

644
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,692
It's an enormous pussy.

645
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:23,876
Staring straight at you.

646
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:25,739
A message from God.

647
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:28,806
Come here, let me show you something.

648
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:31,901
I'm gonna put some pussies
on either side. Yeah?

649
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:33,718
Like Brazilian foliage.

650
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:34,865
Nice and tidy, yeah?

651
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,151
Nice and tidy,
that's the one.

652
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,300
Bill?

653
00:53:44,132 --> 00:53:45,953
Fuck.
Me.

654
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,494
Come here.

655
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:50,672
Are you alright, mate?

656
00:53:51,526 --> 00:53:52,768
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

657
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,149
You're looking stoosh.

658
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:02,395
What the fuck do you
bring him here for?

659
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:11,703
I like the idea.

660
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:14,431
I want to smash a couple
of those for a while now.

661
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:16,250
But not with you.

662
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:17,775
Are you fucking mad?

663
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,939
Ah c'mon, Bill.

664
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,941
We're stronger with you in it.

665
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:23,202
Always were.

666
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:26,573
Alright, get in the cage
with my boy.

667
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:28,726
Let's see if your arshole
is still intact.

668
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,779
You fucked of to the city
and left him for dead, so...

669
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:35,762
This is where we are.

670
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,120
All this trouble now,
we don't need him.

671
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,233
No, no, no...

672
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,619
We can do this.

673
00:54:39,857 --> 00:54:41,513
And he fucking laughs around.

674
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,851
True.

675
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,474
Oi!

676
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:04,866
Mitch!

677
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:06,491
Mitch!

678
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:08,804
Come here.

679
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,284
How are you?

680
00:55:11,824 --> 00:55:12,824
I'm alright.

681
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,169
Can we go now?

682
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,384
What are you gonna do
about the fucking ticket?

683
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:43,408
What you're gonna do...

684
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:45,905
Is you are gonna go on,
call the number on your ticket...

685
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,599
And you're gonna pay it
like a good boy, within 14 days...

686
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,082
Or it will double.

687
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:52,037
Next time you
park around here...

688
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,770
Read the fucking signs.

689
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:57,736
Open your mouth,
you lacking fucking prick.

690
00:56:00,506 --> 00:56:01,647
Clownshoes.

691
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:03,683
Fancy a pint?

692
00:56:17,276 --> 00:56:19,346
I was thinking about
going to Spain.

693
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,419
I've never been out of England before.

694
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,583
No, honoust, I've never done it.

695
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:27,468
Don't expect the beach,
we're gonna head for the hills.

696
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,330
Yeah, I'm up for that.

697
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:31,009
I'll make some calls.

698
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:32,962
What about your little brother?

699
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:34,938
Don't worry about him.

700
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,442
We're going.

701
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,566
Have you got any roads?

702
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:43,989
Yeah.

703
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:49,020
I was thinking, yeah,
if we do go to Spain...

704
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:50,780
Do you reckon we could
go to the new Cup?

705
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:53,823
I've heard about it.

706
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:02,277
Yeah, mate.

707
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:07,109
Yeah, we'll go both.

708
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:10,505
Yeah, do something with that.

709
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:13,825
I said: Do something with that.

710
00:57:16,324 --> 00:57:19,121
I just remember I would
pick up my brother.

711
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,776
See you in a bit.

712
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,632
Oi, oi!
That's a 50 pound fine in here.

713
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:35,655
What?

714
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,894
Now listen...

715
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:54,786
Enjoy these,
these are smuggled...

716
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:56,832
All the way over from Cuba.

717
00:57:56,876 --> 00:57:58,947
From my midget pal...

718
00:57:58,972 --> 00:57:59,853
Guan.

719
00:57:59,878 --> 00:58:02,487
Smuggled them.
Up his arse.

720
00:58:03,304 --> 00:58:05,108
They taste like it, mate.

721
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,105
Yeah, well.

722
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:08,413
It's a long flight.

723
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:15,314
Let's go down there...

724
00:58:15,345 --> 00:58:16,666
And knock them all out.

725
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,460
No.

726
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:20,195
Not this lad,
I mean they got teeth.

727
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:22,224
Seriously.
They're not silly.

728
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,184
Alright, we gotta trade careful.

729
00:58:24,683 --> 00:58:26,285
I mean, there are only
a few that count.

730
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:27,504
If we got the head off...

731
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:29,818
The rest would scatter.
Guaranteed.

732
00:58:30,234 --> 00:58:32,632
As long as we are straight,
I don't give a fuck about the other lot.

733
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:34,565
I'm straight.
You?

734
00:58:42,696 --> 00:58:44,439
You know what this means.

735
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:46,562
Fuck that.

736
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:48,403
Don't be soft Mitch,
come on!

737
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,706
Trust me, you do not
want me at play.

738
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:52,630
Right, boy.

739
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:54,370
It's not everyday that
you win one of these.

740
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:55,493
We're gonna celebrate.

741
00:58:55,584 --> 00:58:56,732
With a drinking game.

742
00:58:57,669 --> 00:58:59,098
I'll put a song on.

743
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,023
And everytime he says 'house'...

744
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:02,419
You lot, will take a drink.

745
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:04,656
Everytime he says 'street'...

746
00:59:05,018 --> 00:59:06,534
You lot drink.

747
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:08,220
Barman!

748
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:10,054
Do a shot now.
- Sure.

749
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:16,957
Are you having a
reunion without me?

750
01:00:17,472 --> 01:00:19,167
Did I miss your email?

751
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:22,545
Or is it 'cause I'm a copper?

752
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:26,680
Mitch.
A word with you, please.

753
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:41,593
Yeah, 6 pm tomorrow.

754
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,164
Railerstreet.

755
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,813
Yeah, he is dealing with this one.

756
01:00:49,381 --> 01:00:51,436
Cause I got shit with my brother.

757
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,956
Let's get it done, yeah?

758
01:00:58,999 --> 01:00:59,999
Cool.

759
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:51,979
Who?

760
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:54,213
It's just a little pick me up.

761
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:56,707
Turn around.

762
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:09,781
Hello mate.

763
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,172
You're about to get fucked.

764
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:18,131
What the..?!

765
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:29,434
Oops.

766
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:35,106
What couldn't wait?

767
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:40,018
They knicked his righthand
man last night.

768
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,113
About time he did something.

769
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:47,037
We should make a move.
- Yeah.

770
01:02:48,614 --> 01:02:49,903
Where are the others?

771
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:51,975
I don't know, I was
waiting for you.

772
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:55,548
He's gonna be out and
about soon, so...

773
01:02:58,345 --> 01:02:59,777
Let's do it tonight.

774
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:01,519
Lovely.

775
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:04,651
So how do you think we knew
you were going to be there?

776
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,582
It's your job,
well done, boys.

777
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:15,223
Yeah, yeah.

778
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,938
But we're aren't sharp, are we?

779
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:18,607
Yeah...

780
01:03:18,779 --> 01:03:20,373
We've must have had some help.

781
01:03:21,905 --> 01:03:24,702
But who would want to help us?

782
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,355
Someone sold you out.

783
01:03:28,293 --> 01:03:30,793
Your chart sheet is a joke, brother.

784
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:33,387
But, on the bright side...

785
01:03:33,753 --> 01:03:36,042
We get to keep you here,
as long as we want.

786
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:39,048
Unless you give us Adam Shanko.

787
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,537
Well, think about it.

788
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:43,073
He goes inside...

789
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,195
You move up.

790
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:47,266
Can't give him up.

791
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:50,111
You might be just saving his life.

792
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:53,201
I hear...

793
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:57,207
There's a few of the old
faces back on the street.

794
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:00,361
That's it.

795
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:03,751
Bottom left pan corner.
Red door.

796
01:04:06,737 --> 01:04:08,729
That one there?

797
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,170
Yeah.

798
01:04:11,954 --> 01:04:13,610
He lives in his moms old house.

799
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,763
We're not going in.

800
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:30,297
I'm going on my own.
- No...

801
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:32,135
You fucking brought us here...

802
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:34,884
We'll go in together.

803
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,515
What the fucking hell
are you doing here?

804
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:38,985
You left your chain in my home...

805
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:40,420
I wanted to give it back.

806
01:04:41,815 --> 01:04:42,870
Keep it.

807
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:45,848
And you stay the fuck
away from me.

808
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:49,401
Sports all over this gaff.

809
01:04:49,706 --> 01:04:51,451
Don't worry about them,
I clocked them already.

810
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:52,428
I'll deal with them.

811
01:04:52,466 --> 01:04:54,606
Look you lot leaving,
now back off.

812
01:04:56,342 --> 01:04:57,663
I'll go alone...

813
01:04:57,715 --> 01:04:59,964
And sort it out for another time.
Alright?

814
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:01,827
- No.
I'll go.

815
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:03,545
You're not the fucking
guvnor here.

816
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,475
Is this what's it all
about with you, Trent?

817
01:05:07,248 --> 01:05:08,631
I thought this was
about Mickey?

818
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,948
You two, I can't have this here,
not now, alright?

819
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,508
Now fuck off,
I'll see you later.

820
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,401
Look, just...

821
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,193
I'll see you later, alright?

822
01:05:20,441 --> 01:05:21,738
- I'm pregnant.

823
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:24,815
What?

824
01:05:25,026 --> 01:05:27,668
Don't look at me like that.
We both know it's yours.

825
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:31,058
So, if you're still here tomorrow...

826
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:32,627
I'm gonna tell her.

827
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,159
Against the wall.

828
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:28,991
We need to talk.

829
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:34,159
I heard you're a man of
actions, not words.

830
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,244
Gun and blade.

831
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,956
Well, it looks like you got 1 gun.

832
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:42,586
Blade.

833
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,949
Sit the fuck down.

834
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,867
Do you mind if I smoke?

835
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:22,882
Yeah.

836
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:24,536
I do.

837
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,543
I'm glad I got away from all this.

838
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:33,815
I pitty you.

839
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:36,484
Can you put that sigaret out, please?

840
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,878
You don't even think about
the future, do you?

841
01:07:48,615 --> 01:07:50,717
What happends when you're my age.

842
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,065
I'm hopeful thinking
you'll never get there.

843
01:07:55,107 --> 01:07:56,350
Trust me.

844
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:58,593
I don't wanna get there.

845
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:02,718
You want my rep, right?

846
01:08:17,588 --> 01:08:18,901
Then shoot me.

847
01:08:27,872 --> 01:08:29,247
But know this...

848
01:08:31,343 --> 01:08:33,851
Everyone around these flats
knows where I am.

849
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:37,928
You kill me here without
facing me on the street...

850
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,869
And you'll be known for what you are...

851
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,110
Scum.

852
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:46,063
But you'll be dead.

853
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:50,131
And me?

854
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:57,504
I then killed a legend.

855
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,363
That will be 2 in a week.

856
01:09:06,013 --> 01:09:07,435
Fuck it.

857
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:11,265
Any last requests,
grandad?

858
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:23,265
Why the fuck are you
looking at me like?

859
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:27,725
That necklace.

860
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:32,922
It's a chain.

861
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:38,861
My mother bought it for me
from Malaysia, for my 18th.

862
01:09:41,957 --> 01:09:43,836
You thought it was bullocks, isn't it?

863
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:46,276
Me and Stephen...

864
01:09:46,301 --> 01:09:47,547
No fucking way.

865
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,346
She's your mom.

866
01:09:49,377 --> 01:09:51,043
Don't fucking talk to me.

867
01:09:51,494 --> 01:09:53,104
I got my family.

868
01:09:53,424 --> 01:09:54,628
You're pointing that gun at it.

869
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:56,992
Get the fuck out of my house.

870
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:59,087
Put the gun down.
It's okay.

871
01:09:59,137 --> 01:10:00,996
She fucking screwed you.

872
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:05,023
Then pull the trigger.

873
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:08,960
Do it!

874
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:10,868
Go on.

875
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:13,915
I'll let you live.

876
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,002
I really don't fucking wanna
know why I shouldn't.

877
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:21,824
Start again.

878
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,158
Like I did.

879
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:25,342
We don't all run away.

880
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,636
You should.

881
01:10:28,678 --> 01:10:30,037
You got untill tomorrow.

882
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:33,964
You don't tell me what to do, yeah?

883
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,307
I can't sleep,
I had a bad dream.

884
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:44,490
Look, just go to next
door for me, yeah?

885
01:10:44,528 --> 01:10:46,716
I'll come to you just
in a bit, alright?

886
01:10:47,898 --> 01:10:48,971
I love you bro.

887
01:10:49,014 --> 01:10:50,296
- Love you too.

888
01:10:57,576 --> 01:10:59,349
Don't be a fucking prick.

889
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,465
Don't.

890
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:04,078
I got lucky.

891
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:06,932
I got a second chance.

892
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:11,929
Don't be stupid and
pass this one up, kid.

893
01:11:14,507 --> 01:11:17,164
You're my birth and 
I will let you live.

894
01:11:18,136 --> 01:11:19,824
But if you're here tomorrow...

895
01:11:20,368 --> 01:11:21,970
Yeah then what?

896
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:24,633
Then I'll fucking kill you.

897
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,883
Mitch Raymond use to run 
a firm called The Guvnors.

898
01:11:48,756 --> 01:11:49,545
Yeah.

899
01:11:50,446 --> 01:11:51,657
You know them well.

900
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:56,858
Too fucking well.

901
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:00,539
You'll probably purview your
mates on a drip.

902
01:12:00,595 --> 01:12:02,736
It would definitely do Shanko.

903
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:07,293
Unless you give me,
what I want.

904
01:12:07,515 --> 01:12:14,519
I am gonna start playing and
watch your fucking family burn.

905
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:18,529
I will make sure not a single copper 
from this station steps in to help.

906
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:21,116
I will take him around your 
fucking house.

907
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,543
I would introduce him to
your fucking family.

908
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,105
Nah.

909
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:36,637
I won't give you Shanko.

910
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,526
I don't want Shanko.

911
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,467
What the fuck do you want then?

912
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:46,326
I want the gun.

913
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,633
How's that gonna help?

914
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:50,693
It's gonna make me look good.

915
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,599
Impossible.

916
01:12:53,818 --> 01:12:57,148
When I've got it, 
it won't be used.

917
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,930
There is no gun.

918
01:13:03,324 --> 01:13:05,042
We don't have one.

919
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,208
You little fucking pig.

920
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:17,538
Outside.
- Nah leave it, Bill.

921
01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:19,959
What the fuck are you 
always defending him for?

922
01:13:19,985 --> 01:13:22,314
He fucking mocked us
off our on turf.

923
01:13:22,339 --> 01:13:24,261
It's a bit more complicated then that.

924
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,601
Nah, nah, it's very uncomplicated.

925
01:13:26,629 --> 01:13:28,277
He walks out on us.

926
01:13:28,302 --> 01:13:29,782
He cost Charly his life.

927
01:13:29,807 --> 01:13:31,281
I shouldn't have let it go.

928
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:32,363
But I did.

929
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:36,484
And now he wants to come and
disrespect us, on our own manner.

930
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:38,158
And I'm thinking...

931
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,884
I'm having none of that.

932
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:57,011
He's my son.

933
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,166
The kid.

934
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:01,689
I've just found out.

935
01:14:04,895 --> 01:14:07,317
I'm probably gonna have
to batter this lad tomorrow.

936
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:12,075
It's not ideal, but I don't
a fucking choise.

937
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,405
I was thinking that 
the few of us...

938
01:14:18,445 --> 01:14:21,227
Sit down and have a 
quiet drink together.

939
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:38,180
I feel like a donkeys arshole.

940
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:43,030
See you...

941
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,715
You're a right shit stirrer.

942
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,942
All afternoon he's have
me go on about you.

943
01:14:46,967 --> 01:14:48,734
All fucking afternoon.

944
01:14:48,759 --> 01:14:49,758
You were lucky...

945
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:50,885
Cause if I would've pinged you...

946
01:14:50,926 --> 01:14:54,117
You would've gone over like
an old granny of a sheet of ice.

947
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:55,987
I'll drink to that.

948
01:14:58,072 --> 01:14:59,119
Cheers.

949
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:58,195
I got set up.

950
01:16:01,697 --> 01:16:04,330
Which means one 
of you fuckers...

951
01:16:04,377 --> 01:16:05,760
Is a grass.

952
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:18,594
Someone needs to talk.

953
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:21,623
See this boys...

954
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,391
This is all I've got.

955
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,102
I ain't got no family.

956
01:16:33,277 --> 01:16:34,934
I ain't got no mom.

957
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,707
I ain't got no fucking dad.

958
01:16:38,788 --> 01:16:40,397
You boys...

959
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:43,933
You boys is all I've got.

960
01:16:47,622 --> 01:16:50,208
So when someone breaks my trust.

961
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:53,798
It fucking hurts, you know?

962
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,711
Woods, step forward.

963
01:17:03,722 --> 01:17:05,105
Talk to me, Woods.

964
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:07,971
Ain't no grass here.

965
01:17:07,996 --> 01:17:09,043
Is that right?

966
01:17:09,473 --> 01:17:11,855
Yeah, not here.

967
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:17,643
You need to find one, Woods.

968
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,945
Today...

969
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:25,425
Woods...

970
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,465
Is being promoted.

971
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:31,619
With Trey inside, I need a
new guy, and Woods...

972
01:17:32,545 --> 01:17:34,295
You're my new guy.

973
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,861
Your first assignment...

974
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:41,559
Is to cut one of these 
fuckers for being a grass.

975
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:43,820
I don't care who it is...

976
01:17:44,638 --> 01:17:46,404
Someone gets cut.

977
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,035
Now!

978
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:01,200
Hold him.

979
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:02,122
I said nothing.

980
01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:02,731
Hold him!

981
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,936
I said nothing!

982
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,107
Tomorrow...

983
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:14,293
We go into war.

984
01:18:17,688 --> 01:18:19,414
There's gonna be loads of them.

985
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:23,177
That's what I need you to do...

986
01:18:23,202 --> 01:18:26,221
Is round up every little
fucking rat on this estate

987
01:18:27,156 --> 01:18:29,031
To come fight, alright?

988
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:35,474
Be ready.

989
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,763
Where's Mitch?

990
01:18:58,704 --> 01:19:00,376
I think he's lost his head.

991
01:19:00,615 --> 01:19:02,685
He was saying some weird
shit in the pub last night.

992
01:19:02,745 --> 01:19:05,683
Some bird came in and
he just left in a hurry.

993
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:06,649
What do you mean?

994
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:09,207
Like he said; He lost 
his fucking nut.

995
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,472
Ain't no fucking surprise there, is it?

996
01:19:11,522 --> 01:19:12,944
Anyway, fuck him.

997
01:19:12,969 --> 01:19:14,978
You stay in here, alright?

998
01:19:15,003 --> 01:19:16,984
We need to focus.

999
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,485
Let me talk to him.

1000
01:19:21,377 --> 01:19:22,236
Trent.

1001
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:23,623
Trent.

1002
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:24,490
What?

1003
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,706
Alright, so what are 
we gonna do now?

1004
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:27,834
We'll be fine.

1005
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,267
We got plenty here.

1006
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:31,350
Mitch!

1007
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:33,254
Mitch!

1008
01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:46,674
Mitch?!

1009
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:37,934
Here's Malor.

1010
01:20:37,959 --> 01:20:39,583
- Were is he?
Hello Ange.

1011
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,088
I'm going to Fredcast to find him.

1012
01:20:41,113 --> 01:20:42,408
Angie, he's fine.

1013
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:43,529
I've seen him.

1014
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:44,512
He's coming home.

1015
01:20:44,537 --> 01:20:45,368
Are you with him?

1016
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,101
Not right now, no.
But I'm meeting him.

1017
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:50,452
He's not on the estate.
He's fine. He'll be home later.

1018
01:20:50,486 --> 01:20:51,369
Where is he?

1019
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:55,035
Go home, wait.
I'll bring him to you, trust me.

1020
01:26:09,603 --> 01:26:10,814
Yeah, this is me, it's Malor...

1021
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:13,459
I need an ambulance.

1022
01:26:13,491 --> 01:26:16,538
A gunshot injury of 
urgent medical attention.

1023
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:19,913
I have the suspect
in custody.

1024
01:26:22,842 --> 01:26:24,646
I've secured the gun.

1025
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:28,070
Just get an ambulance here, will you?

1026
01:26:30,205 --> 01:26:31,869
Big tough guy like you...

1027
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:33,439
You'll be alright.

1028
01:26:59,832 --> 01:27:01,489
You need a bit pressure on it.

1029
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,399
Oi, I made a promise to Angie
I would take you home, alright?

1030
01:27:06,961 --> 01:27:08,492
So we get you patched up...

1031
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:09,908
And I'm gonna get you back.

1032
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:19,587
You're going home soon!

1033
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:53,455
I hope and pray,
that you make the right decision...

1034
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:55,807
And walk away from this fight.

1035
01:27:55,841 --> 01:27:57,669
From this life...

1036
01:27:57,929 --> 01:28:01,171
But even as I write this letter
I know that you won't...

1037
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,701
Because it's who we are.

1038
01:28:04,264 --> 01:28:05,514
For me...

1039
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:08,269
To find the strenght and
courage to walk away...

1040
01:28:08,463 --> 01:28:11,354
It took finding someone 
I couldn't affort to lose.

1041
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:14,332
Someone who loved me for who I am.

1042
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:15,974
And now...

1043
01:28:16,008 --> 01:28:19,008
Because of a mistake I made
20 years ago...

1044
01:28:19,432 --> 01:28:21,885
I find myself right back
where I started.

1045
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:24,422
Funny...

1046
01:28:24,717 --> 01:28:26,733
How faith never forgets.

1047
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:30,940
One of us won't
be going home tomorrow.

1048
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:34,231
You and I both know that.

1049
01:28:35,138 --> 01:28:37,673
But I guess there comes 
a point in every mans life...

1050
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:40,392
When he has to stop pretending
he's something he's not.

1051
01:28:42,132 --> 01:28:43,945
I'll get my revenge for Mickey.

1052
01:28:44,997 --> 01:28:46,794
He was a good man.

1053
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,914
You could've learned a lot from him...

1054
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:52,253
He would've told you to walk...

1055
01:28:52,557 --> 01:28:54,784
Cause it's the bravest thing
you could do.

1056
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:00,518
No one ever drowned by 
getting in water, son.

1057
01:29:02,016 --> 01:29:04,487
You'll only drown if you stay in it.
